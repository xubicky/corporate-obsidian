Production unwound amid the OPEC embargo and the nationalization of the country's oil industry under Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA).\n\nVolumes recovered in the late twentieth century before declining during the presidencies of Hugo Chávez and Nicolas Maduro, reaching a low of around 665,000 bpd in 2021 after the U.S. placed sanctions on PDVSA.\n\nToday's events to watch\n\n\\* U.S. initial jobless claims (8:30 AM EDT), trade deficit (8:30 AM EDT), Q3 productivity (8:30 AM EDT), consumer credit (3:00 PM EDT)\\* U.S. corporate earnings: Acuity Brands, Commercial Metals, Greenbrier Companies, Lindsay Corp, RPM International, TD Synnex\n\nWant to receive the Morning Bid in your inbox every weekday morning?

The [gauges both dropped yesterday](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/global-stocks-markets-dow-news-01-07-2026-9ca6a8eb), breaking a 2026 start-of-the-year rally.\n\nTrump called late Wednesday for a military budget of $1.5 trillion, more than $500 billion more than the Pentagon is expected to receive this fiscal year. [Defense stocks jumped](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-01-08-2026/card/defense-stocks-jump-after-trump-calls-for-1-5-trillion-defense-budget-d2L6xw0T00YQOR9eZBd2) in early premarket trading, with Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and RTX each rising about 5% or more. European weapons makers also rallied.\n\nTrump's announcement on social media followed a series of posts that knocked defense stocks earlier Wednesday. The president also moved to ban large institutional investors from [buying single-family homes](https://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/trump-housing-large-investor-single-family-home-ban-13e06f61).\n\nOil prices rose Thursday, with Brent crude futures topping $60 a barrel. Overnight, [The Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/trump-venezuela-oil-us-control-plan-265a39c1) that the White House is planning a sweeping initiative to dominate the Venezuelan oil industry for years to come, which Trump believes could lower cut prices to $50 a barrel. Meantime, the U.S. has accelerated its campaign against [shadow-fleet tankers shipping Venezuelan crude](https://www.wsj.com/world/u-s-forces-launch-operation-to-seize-fleeing-oil-tanker-0d6443ab).\n\nLater today, investors will get readouts on jobless claims and the trade deficit.

The deal could initially require cargoes that were ⁠bound for China to be rerouted. Venezuela could be seeking to unload millions of barrels of oil that are stranded in tankers and storage facilities to avoid additional escalation with the United States.\n\nTrump had demanded that Venezuela open up to U.S. oil companies or risk escalating military intervention. After that, U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro at the weekend.\n\nAnalysts say the agreement would keep prices low in an oversupplied market.\n\n\"Venezuela's oil exports to the United States have first and foremost disrupted the U.S. market, which will also deepen the global oversupply,\" said Yang An, an analyst at Haitong Futures.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts estimated the oil market could reach a ‍surplus of as many as 3 million barrels per day in ‌the first half of 2026, based on weak growth in ⁠demand last year and rising supply from OPEC and non-OPEC producers.\n\nHowever, the prospect of higher, cheaply extracted Venezuelan oil exports could pause ‍expansion of productive capacity in the U.S. and elsewhere, analysts at BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, said in a note on Wednesday.\n\nVenezuela has been selling its flagship crude grade, Merey, at around $22 per barrel below Brent for delivery at its ports.\n\n\"That raises the expected price of ⁠oil over the medium term, especially if ‌the Venezuelan regime survives,\" the BMI analysts said.",

If the U.S. were to lift sanctions on Venezuelan oil it could release barrels “and only add to the surplus that the market is already experiencing,” says Mizuho’s Robert Yawger. A substantial increase in Venezuelan production is widely expected to be a long-term prospect, although from around 1 million barrels a day at present “Venezuela could get to 1.5 million rather quickly,” Yawger says. “And I think Gulf coast refiners would be happy to take those barrels.” WTI settles down 2% at $57.13 a barrel, compared with $57.32 Friday. Brent falls 1.7% to $60.70 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com) [...] ### Crude Futures Ease Back From Early Gains\n\n1057 ET – Oil futures relinquish early gains with the market still weighing the implications of developments in Venezuela, while concerns about oversupply in 2026 remain. The ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro may have briefly camouflaged those concerns, but “I suspect the veil is going to be lifted again,” says Societe Generale’s Ben Hoff. “We’re going to have to face the hard reality that we are looking at a wall of crude heading onshore, something I think has been on people’s minds,” he adds. Crude’s move higher in the wake of the U.S. operation to remove Maduro was “more short-term market sentiment than anything fundamental,” he says. WTI is off 0.1% at $58.26 a barrel and Brent is near flat at $61.75.(anthony.harrup@wsj.com)",

Producers across the U.S. have watched the best drilling locations dry up and breakeven prices rise.\n\n\"$50 oil is really where production would start to fall,\" said Matthew Bernstein, Vice President, North America oil and gas at Rystad Energy.\n\nRystad sees onshore U.S. output, excluding Alaska, declining by around 150,000 bpd through 2026 in a $50 price environment.\n\nTechnological improvements have allowed drillers to eke out more oil at lower prices, but some analysts and industry participants have warned those improvements may be approaching their limit.\n\nThe OPEC+ producer group opted to pause production target increases for the first quarter of 2026, amid ample global supplies. OPEC could, however, start increasing output again as it seeks to take market share from U.S. shale producers.\n\nRedirecting Venezuelan barrels into the U.S. market is part of a broader effort to combat inflation by pressuring oil prices, Michael Alfaro, CIO of Gallo Partners, a regulatory - and policy-focused hedge fund said. While Trump is supportive of U.S. shale in principle, lower oil prices combined with steel tariffs, are two persistent headwinds for this group, he added.\n\n\"I’m very much in a wait-and-see mode because there are still big unanswered questions,\" said Mike Oestmann, CEO of shale producer Tall City Exploration in the Permian Basin.\n\nReporting by Georgina McCartney and Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; Editing by Liz Hampton, Simon Webb and Diane Craft\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Arathy Somasekhar](/authors/arathy-somasekhar/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nHouston-based energy reporter focused on oil markets and energy companies.

Points\n\n* Tech gains remain too small to offset China’s deep and persistent property downturn, Rhodium Group said.\n* Real estate weakness and automation threaten jobs and future growth targets.\n* Greater reliance on exports raises exposure to tariffs and trade tensions, Rhodium added.\n\nA tower crane stands above residential buildings in an urban district in the afternoon light, on January 9, 2026, in Chongqing, China.\n\nCheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING — China's push into high-tech industries isn't large enough to offset the country's property slump, leaving the economy more exposed to trade tensions, U.S.-based research firm Rhodium Group said in a report Monday.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2025, new industries such as artificial intelligence, robotics and electric cars added just 0.8 percentage points to economic output, while real estate and other traditional sectors saw a combined 6 percentage point decline, the report said. The analysis drew on official Chinese data and industry-specific sources.\n\nThe findings come as China seeks to boost technological self-reliance in response to U.S. restrictions. Under a five-year development plan set to kick off in earnest in March, [Beijing is doubling down on advanced technologies](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/china-to-bolster-consumption-tech-development-as-us-tensions-simmer.html) with state investment and favorable policies.\n\n\"China's growth strategy isn't going to work,\" Logan Wright, partner at Rhodium and a co-author of the report, told CNBC. \"They're not going to achieve their targeted rates of GDP growth based on the policies they have outlined so far.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO8:0408:04\n\nMorgan Stanley sees 'year of stabilization' for China markets after strong 2025\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nBeijing has targeted annual GDP growth of around 5% in recent years. For China to sustain that pace, new industries would need to expand sevenfold over the next five years to generate the roughly 2 percentage points of annual investment growth required, Rhodium estimated.\n\nThat translates to an additional 2.8 trillion yuan in new investment required this year — or 120% more than in 2025. While investment in artificial intelligence or robotics could increase in the next year or two, other emerging industries are unlikely to sustain such rapid growth, the analysts said.\n\n\"Electric vehicles have likely already reached their fastest rates of growth, and output in the industry may be slowing in the years ahead,\" the Rhodium report said.\n\n## Property drag deepens\n\nWhile Beijing has prioritized [high-tech development](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/10/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-a-rival-ai-strategy.html), it has taken fewer steps to address a yearslong slump in real estate. The sector [once accounted for more than a quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/09/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-the-hidden-drag-on-chinas-economy.html) of the economy. New home sales by floor area last year fell to levels [not seen since 2009](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-dcid0mnIi8knATU9vEyWg), according to a report last week by the China Real Estate Information Corp.\n\nOnly in recent weeks have sighs appeared that some policymakers are [considering more forceful property support](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/china-property-slump-policy-shift-qiushi-2026-ahead-march-meeting.html). China's top leaders are due to formalize economic targets for the year at an annual parliamentary meeting in March.\n\nA macro outlook published by global investment firm KKR estimated that property weakness will shave 1.2 percentage points off China's GDP growth this year. Even with a projected 2.6 percentage point contribution from digital technologies, the estimated total growth was still on the low end at 4.6%.\n\n\"Despite a potential 5% growth target for 2026, headwinds from real estate and a weak job market cast doubt on achievability,\" the report said. KKR predicts the property drag could halve in 2027, but sees limited improvement in digital industries or consumer demand.\n\n## From jobs to trade tensions\n\nAn overemphasis on tech could have broader economic consequences.\n\nNew industrial sectors may offer higher wages, but they employ far fewer people than traditional industries, the Rhodium analysis found.\n\nIncreased factory automation, coupled with China's already high 30% share of global manufacturing output, could lead to the loss of up to 100 million jobs over the next decade — a displacement that would exceed the total workforce of most developed economies, KKR said.\n\nChina's urban unemployment rate remained [above 5%](http://english.scio.gov.cn/pressroom/2025-12/15/content_118228465.html) for much of last year, while youth unemployment has been [about three times higher.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/17/china-youth-unemployment-civil-service-jobs-economy-slowdown.html)\n\nSince it's unlikely that domestic investment, even in newer industries, will produce sufficient demand, \"Beijing will become even more dependent upon gaining market share in export markets,\" the Rhodium report said.\n\n\"China will remain even more reliant upon exports in the future, leaving the economy vulnerable to new trade restrictions,\" the report said.\n\nAs lower-priced Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, have expanded overseas, Mexico and the European Union have joined the U.S. in raising tariffs on imports from China.\n\nWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox  \n [Subscribe now](https://www.cnbc.com/lander?id=chinaconnection-newsletter)\n\nChina's economic imbalance mirrors a similar [divergence in the U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/25/ai-spending-is-boosting-the-economy-many-businesses-in-survival-mode.html), where AI-linked companies have led stock market gains, while [other parts of the economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/business/the-ai-boom-economy.html) have struggled.\n\nBut many in Beijing argue that the country has longer-term interests at stake.\n\nZhang Jianping, a deputy director at China's Commerce Ministry, told CNBC last week that the country's policies are designed to support innovation over multiple years. Traditional industries such as steel and real estate, he added, must integrate new technologies to remain competitive.",

His first stint came in 2007 and 2008, when Beijing hosted its first Olympic Games, and the financial crisis hit much of the world. He later served again in 2015 and 2016, as populist movements rose globally and gave Donald Trump his first term as U.S. President.\n\nFast forward a decade, and U.S. businesses have endured everything from the pandemic to escalating tariffs. But the past decade of what Zimmerman calls \"experimenting with competition\" could now give way to something new, with Trump expected to visit China in April.\n\nThis picture taken on November 6, 2018 shows a Chinese and US flag at a booth during the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai.\n\nJohannes Eisele | AFP | Getty Images\n\n*Here are the highlights of our conversation, with responses condensed for clarity:*\n\n**Why are you staying engaged at such a high level, after nearly 30 years in China?**\n\nThe reason I'm involved is because I think this is a very important year.\n\n2026 is important, not just because [it's] the 250th anniversary of the U.S., but the U.S. and China have had 10 years of experimenting with competition, experimenting with calls for decoupling and de-risking.\n\nHas that worked?

So it's now time to go back and, in a way that may be visionary, to get us back on track to have ongoing dialogues, ongoing engagement, because I think, at the end of the day, that will be in the best interest of the U.S. and China.\n\n**Are many U.S. companies decoupling from China?**\n\nNo. We're seeing an evolution. People are starting to adjust. For many sectors, China continues to be a critical market. But it's also an essential part of the global supply chain.\n\nAmerican companies are adjusting to this new normal within the U.S.-China relationship. But there has been some diversifying, and that's a healthy strategy that companies are looking at, but we are not seeing wholesale decoupling at all.\n\nIt's important that we have senior**-**level meetings that bring some clarity, some certainty, some continuity to the relationship.\n\nDialogue matters **—** even the smallest, positive signals, at the presidential level, on engagement are very, very important. Regular, ongoing engagement helps reduce any potential misunderstandings and lowers the risk of unexpected policy shocks, like the back-and-forth over tariffs.\n\n**What kind of opportunity do U.S. businesses have in China as domestic competition rises?**\n\nWe have our white paper, which, in a way, allows us to engage with the Chinese government to seek changes that are positive.\n\nProtection of intellectual property is not just an issue for foreign companies. It's also an issue for Chinese companies.\n\nBoth sides need to tone down the national security issues and not view every slight as a national security matter.\n\nWe can't have an environment where every foreigner is targeted as a potential threat. And that goes both ways: when Chinese companies go to the U.S., we can't take the view that it's a threat to the communities they want to operate in.\n\n**Is the CEO of the China operations losing influence on headquarters in the U.S.?**\n\nIt's something that needs further attention post-pandemic. But that's something that is just a circumstance, especially given what took place during the pandemic, when travel came to a halt.\n\nBut when you look at AmCham, the U.S.-China Business Council and the National Committee for U.S.-China Relations, there's now increased interest in making sure CEOs, academic leaders, as well as congressional leaders, travel to [China to] understand what the environment is all about.\n\nWe try to encourage more people-to-people exchanges. I'm going to be out and about in the community, emphasizing the importance of education as well as the arts. For example, I'm going to a conference at the Juilliard School in Tianjin.\n\n**What's on your agenda at AmCham China for 2026?**\n\nIn some respects**,** we're focused on April when President Trump is planning to come to China. We're hopeful that AmCham will be able to play a role in that. There is a focus on that, and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of work leading up to that visit.\n\nThere'll be some agreements, some understanding, maybe a memorandum of understanding that may come out of that.\n\nWe're not expecting a grand bargain. There just isn't enough time. It was last summer, and we were in the middle of a trade war. And only since October, President Xi, as well as President Trump, met in South Korea, have we started a process [around] let's meet, let's talk, let's keep engaging.\n\nSo I think we're on the right track, but we'll just have to see the progress between now and April. But we're optimistic the signals will come out positive. And again, any level of confidence that can be received from those meetings, I think, is very important to the business community.\n\nA lot of President Trump's predecessors were very visionary about what they viewed as the future of U.S.-China relations.\n\nAnd so, this year, we're hoping that President Trump will also be visionary and seek to move the relationship forward in a way that mutually benefits both the United States and China, its companies, consumers, workers and farmers.\n\n## Top TV picks on CNBC\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:3902:39\n\nUS-China tech co-dependence may grow in 2026: Eurasia Group\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nEurasia Group's Xiaomeng Lu explained why China's tech competition with the U.S. remains intense, but argued that tech co-dependence may expand in 2026, driven by easing export controls, cross-border deals, and the global uptake of Chinese open-source AI models.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO5:0905:09\n\nChina's property slump to persist as consumers shift to rentals: UBS\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nJohn Lam, head of China and Hong Kong property research at UBS Investment Bank, explained why he sees a 10% decline in property prices and new home sales in China for 2026.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO12:3712:37\n\nFantastical to think Venezuela event changed China's decades of Taiwan planning\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nEvan Feigenbaum from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said Venezuela isn't a core interest for China, but if the U.S. were to launch a second strike or a full-scale invasion, China would make \"a lot of hay rhetorically about international law.\"\n\n## Need to know\n\n**China condemns U.S. attack on Venezuela.** Beijing said it was \"[deeply shocked](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/china-response-us-venezuela-strike-economic-interests.html)\" by the U.S. strike on Venezuela Saturday and called for the release of leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife.\n\n**BYD tops Tesla worldwide.** The Chinese automaker officially [sold more](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/chinas-byd-to-overtake-tesla-as-worlds-top-ev-seller-for-first-time.html) battery-powered electric cars than Tesla in 2025 — at 2.26 million units.\n\n**Chinese companies hit Vegas.** Many Chinese humanoid robotic and consumer electronics companies are in Las Vegas this week to showcase their products at the [Consumer Electronics Show](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3338600/chinas-humanoid-robot-makers-hong-kong-start-ups-set-dazzle-ces-2026).\n\n## Quote of the week\n\nBetween the two countries in 2026, we are likely to see some tech co-dependence going on and even growing despite the broader trend of U.S.-China competition.\n\n— [*Xiaomeng Lu, director in Eurasia Group's geo-technology practice*](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/01/02/us-china-tech-co-dependence-may-grow-in-2026-eurasia-group.html)\n\n## In the markets\n\nOnshore Chinese stocks edged higher Wednesday, holding near four-year highs as Beijing continues to push development of its artificial intelligence sector.\n\nGoldman Sachs expects China's equity rally to continue into 2026, though at a slower pace.

McNeal](https://www.cnbc.com/dewardric-mcneal/)\n\n[WATCH LIVE](/live-tv/)\n\nKey Points\n\n* Trump's so-called \"Donroe Doctrine\" framing of Western Hemispheric dominance has led to concerns that China will move on Taiwan to flex its own regional muscle.\n* It is the wrong question to be asking given what has taken place in Venezuela, writes international policy expert Dewardric McNeal.\n* China sees itself as a global power with global interests, ambitions, investments, and supply-chain demands — with the agency to defend and extend those interests in America's so-called backyard.\n\nUS President Donald Trump shows a lapel pin as he speaks during a meeting with US oil companies executives in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on January 9, 2026.\n\nSaul Loeb | Afp | Getty Images\n\nThe conversation in Washington right now is abuzz with talk of [President Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)'s new National Security Strategy and its so-called \"Donroe Doctrine\" framing of Western Hemispheric dominance — a modern corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. That debate had already been simmering in policy circles before the end of last year, but it was turbocharged by the recent U.S. operation in Venezuela. Almost immediately, the familiar question resurfaced: What will China do now?\n\nMuch of that speculation has [fixated on Taiwan](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/us-venezuela-strike-taiwan-china-precedent-russia-ukraine.html). Would Beijing use U.S. kinetic action in Venezuela as justification — or precedent — for moving against the island? That question may be understandable and its implications concerning. However, many believe that it is also the wrong question to be asking.\n\nChina will not use Venezuela as a pretext to invade Taiwan. That is neither how Beijing thinks nor how it operates. Serious analysis demands setting the distraction of seeing China as a reactive power aside, and dealing with a more consequential — and far more uncomfortable — question. It requires that we read and debate China's own strategic documents about our region with the same rigor now being applied to the U.S. National Security Strategy, and take them seriously on their own terms.\n\n[China's newly issued](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202512/10/content_WS693962c3c6d00ca5f9a08069.html) third Policy Paper on Latin America and the Caribbean is not a press release or a reactive and reflexive impulse triggered by Washington. It is a longstanding, well thought out, forward-looking, and deliberately structured approach to achieving China's long-term goals. It includes the range of tools of statecraft that it intends to use, and the pathways through which it plans to sustain its influence. It is an institutional blueprint — dense with political mechanisms, financing pathways, commercial incentives, and a theory of the case for the legitimacy of its engagement and presence in the region rooted in Global South solidarity rather than overt claims of regional hegemony or 18th-century cosplay.\n\nThe [NSS](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf) is explicit about intent. It commits the United States to keeping the hemisphere free of \"hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets,\" ensuring access to \"key strategic locations,\" and denying non-hemispheric competitors' control over \"strategically vital assets.\" Venezuela, in that telling, becomes a proof point: evidence that Washington is prepared to act kinetically to alter political realities when it believes access, stability, or strategic positioning are at risk.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO13:2813:28\n\nBremmer: Trump will focus on increasing military power as it loses economically\n\n[Squawk Box Asia](https://www.cnbc.com/asia-squawk-box/)\n\nBut the Trump NSS also reveals a central analytical vulnerability. It implicitly assumes the United States can grant spheres of influence — cede a region here, consolidate one there — and that so-called \"regional powers\" will accept the arrangement. China does not see itself as a regional power. It sees itself as a global power with global interests, ambitions, investments, and supply-chain demands — and with the agency to defend and extend those interests in America's so-called backyard. The NSS can declare a corollary; it cannot declare away another major power's presence or objectives, particularly one as deeply embedded in the hemisphere as China already is. China's Latin America strategy is engineered to be resilient against exactly this kind of episodic shock.\n\n### How China exerts its influence across the globe\n\nStart with the political architecture. Beijing does not limit its engagement to trade or hydrocarbons, though both [matter a great deal to Beijing](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/china-response-us-venezuela-strike-economic-interests.html). Instead, it pursues head-of-state diplomacy, exchanges between intergovernmental committees, legislature-to-legislature exchanges, political-party engagement, and deep institutional embedding through CELAC, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, a 33-country regional political bloc coordinating cooperation across trade, finance, infrastructure, technology, and people-to-people ties. The objective is explicit: institutionalize influence across \"multi-level, multi-channel\" pathways with a structure that dilutes any single pressure point campaign by the United States. It is far harder to \"flip\" a region when influence runs so deeply through presidents, parties, parliaments, technocrats, students, consumers, and subnational actors simultaneously.\n\nThe economics reinforce that architecture. China frames its engagement — accurately or not — as co-production and co-dependence rather than exploitation or charity. The strategy emphasizes infrastructure connectivity, logistics management, digital infrastructure, smart cities, industrial parks, manufacturing cooperation, and export support. These projects create domestic constituencies: jobs, contracts, port throughput, wages, and broad political winners in the region. Financial cooperation sweetens the model further through local-currency settlement, RMB clearing arrangements, credit and debt swap lines, and even Panda bonds on offer. The aim is straightforward: reduce exposure to U.S. financial leverage, political pressure points, and sanctions risk over time.\n\nTrump's [push for U.S. oil companies to invest](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/what-the-big-oil-executives-told-trump-about-investing-in-venezuela.html) in Venezuela offered a series of security guarantees but surfaced a familiar constraint: executives emphasized that investment also hinges on long-term financing, risk-sharing, and enforceable contracts — support China routinely provides its firms through policy banks and export credits — while Washington has yet to signal a clear willingness to deploy comparable tools via the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation(DFC), Ex-Im Bank, or multilateral finance.\n\nAnd those financial support and assistance tools should not be pursued in a vacuum; when done well, they are designed to anchor influence in physical strategic assets — natural resources, ports, logistics hubs, energy infrastructure, and transit corridors — where economics and geopolitics inevitably intersect.\n\n### $500 billion in trade, Panama Canal confrontation\n\nScale matters. China-Latin America trade exceeded $500 billion in 2024, and the region represents more than 670 million consumers, many of whom are drawn to Chinese products on price, availability, and increasingly quality. These are not marginal markets. They are structural to China's global growth model and export strategy.\n\nBeijing is also candid — if selectively so — about its interest in strategic resources. Energy and critical minerals feature prominently, alongside language about long-term supply arrangements and local-currency pricing. Access spans the value chain from extraction to utilization. For U.S. policymakers, investors, and CEOs, this is the commercial backbone the NSS must contend with. This is not about nostalgia for the Monroe Doctrine; it is a 21st-century strategy designed to achieve many of the same outcomes through more modern means and more seductive rhetoric.\n\nThe Panama Canal brings these strategies into direct collision. China's policy paper treats ports, logistics, and maritime cooperation as first-order instruments of development and influence — and, in a crisis, as latent strategic assets to be exploited during a military confrontation with the regional hegemon (the U.S.). The NSS, meanwhile, explicitly flags \"key strategic locations\" and acknowledges how commercial infrastructure can be repurposed for military use. Panama — more than Venezuela — is where these approaches collide most sharply. [Ongoing debates over port concessions and terminal control](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/22/tanker-seizures-venezuela-oil-china.html) underscore that both Washington and Beijing view the canal itself and canal-adjacent assets as strategic, not merely commercial in nature.\n\nCrew members of Chinese Cosco Shipping Rose container ship wave Chinese and Panamenian flag before China's President Xi Jinping and Panama's Juan Carlso Varela, arrive at the Cocoli locks in the expanded Panama Canal, in Panama City, Panama on December 3, 2018.\n\nLuis Acosta | Afp | Getty Images\n\nSo, does U.S. action in Venezuela change the calculus? In the long run, no.\n\nIt will raise risk premiums for many — for Chinese firms, regional leaders, and global companies caught between compliance regimes, complicate logistics and supply chains, and further the weaponization of market access. It will push some governments to hedge more carefully, demand higher \"insurance\" from Beijing, or seek stronger economic and security assurances from Washington. But it does not erase the fundamentals of what China has spent two decades building: trade corridors, lending relationships, political networks, and now an explicit push into high-tech cooperation — from EVs, AI, and satellites to aerospace and digital trade, and aligning closely with where many Latin American economies want to go.\n\nZoom out one level further and the logic extends north. Greenland and the Arctic are not separate conversations; they are the same set of arguments, just on ice. Washington frames Greenland through minerals, shipping lanes, and military access. Beijing frames the Arctic as an international space with global stakes, governed by international law, where non-Arctic states have legitimate interests. If the U.S. believes spheres can be secured through doctrine plus decisive action, China's operating assumption is the opposite. It believes in focusing its pushback on arguments that the U.S. has used for decades to justify their presence in the Asia-Pacific region — that states have a right to the global commons, that big states have global interests that must be protected, and that a long-term and well establish persistent presence in a region must be respected. China takes these same positions with respect to Latin America and Greenland.\n\nThe action in Venezuela does show that the Trump administration is more serious than its predecessors about reasserting hemispheric dominance — and that the NSS is not merely rhetorical. But China will not be rushing for the exits in the Western Hemisphere. It is deeply entrenched. Smaller powers have agency too. They will not be dictated to without far richer incentives, protections, or more sustained pressure than a single special forces operation can provide.\n\nIf Washington wants a hemisphere that chooses the United States rather than submits to it, it must compete with China's full-stack approach: finance, infrastructure, technology, people-to-people exchange, affordable products, political access, and a compelling narrative of partnership. A declaration in an NSS and one dramatic operation are short-term events. China's engagement in Latin America is a long game, and the competition it sets in motion will be neither quick nor simple.\n\n—*By* [*Dewardric McNeal*](https://www.cnbc.com/dewardric-mcneal/)*, Managing Director and Senior Policy Analyst at Longview Global, and a CNBC Contributor*\n\n## [More In The Bottom Line](https://www.cnbc.com/global-cfo-council/)\n\n[The crypto ATM's days in America may be numbered](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/bitcoin-crypto-atm-scam-fraud-regulation.html)\n\n[Kevin Williams](https://www.cnbc.com/kevin-williams/)\n\n[Op-ed: China won the 2025 battle in Trump's trade war.

The Trade Management Market focuses on software and services that help organizations efficiently manage international trade operations, including compliance, documentation, customs filing, and tariff management. It supports businesses in navigating complex global trade regulations, reducing operational risks, and improving supply chain visibility.\n\n**Download PDF Brochure@**[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=70680100](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=70680100&utm_campaign=trademanagementmarket&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=referral)\n\n**Large Enterprises segment to have the highest market share during the forecast period**\n\nComplex trade operations are handled by large businesses in industries like consumer goods and retail, healthcare, aerospace and defence, and transportation and logistics. These businesses have a very robust and extensive network of regionally dispersed suppliers and partners. Large businesses handle the import and export of high-value items to and from many nations. Large firms are important players in the trade management market because they manage the extensive network and adhere to the rules to avoid harsh penalties.\n\n**Transportation and Logistics is expected have the highest market share during the forecast period**\n\nThe transportation and logistics industry has benefited greatly from rising globalisation. As new technologies streamline its basic processes, the transportation and logistics sector is undergoing a digital transition. The transportation and logistics sectors are under pressure to reduce operational costs and streamline trade procedures as a result of the expansion of global trade. Trade management tools give transportation and logistics organisations the visibility they need to oversee shipments and inventories and deliver dependable services.\n\n**North America region to record the highest market share in the trade management market**\n\nDuring the projected period, North America is anticipated to hold the biggest market share for trade management. North America, which is regarded as one of the most developed regions in terms of technology adoption and infrastructure, makes up the majority of GTM solutions and services. Another critical element supporting the expansion of the trade management sector is a robust infrastructure supporting international trade in this area. The expansion of the trade management market in North America is projected to be supported by significant investments in the aerospace and defence, healthcare, and life sciences sectors.\n\n**Request Sample Pages@**[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=70680100](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=70680100&utm_campaign=trademanagementmarket&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=referral)\n\n**Unique Features in the Trade Management Market**\n\nTrade management platforms come with built-in compliance engines that automatically update and enforce global trade regulations, tariff changes, sanctions lists, and restricted party screening. This reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and protects businesses from costly fines and shipment holds.\n\nOne of the standout features is real-time visibility into trade operations, including shipment tracking, customs clearance status, and documentation flow. This transparency enables quicker response to delays, exceptions, or disruptions across global supply chains.\n\nInnovative tools for tariff classification, duty drawback processing, free trade agreement (FTA) qualification, and duty optimization help companies reduce landed costs. These features empower users to strategically plan imports/exports and maximize cost savings.\n\nTrade management solutions uniquely offer centralized creation, validation, and storage of all trade documents—such as commercial invoices, packing lists, certificates of origin, and bills of lading—facilitating accuracy, audit readiness, and faster customs processing.\n\n**Major Highlights of the Trade Management Market**\n\nThe trade management market has seen significant expansion as global trade volumes increase and e-commerce continues to flourish. Businesses are investing in robust trade solutions to manage the complexities of international shipment flows, cross-border compliance, and multi-modal logistics more efficiently.\n\nA major highlight is the strong adoption of cloud-native trade management systems that offer scalability, real-time data access, and seamless integration with ERP, TMS, and customs systems. These platforms enable better collaboration, faster deployment, and lower IT overhead.\n\nWith constantly evolving trade regulations, companies are prioritizing advanced compliance automation, tariff management, and restricted party screening. This emphasis helps avoid fines, shipment delays, and reputational risk while maintaining smoother customs clearance.\n\nModern trade management solutions are incorporating analytics and AI-driven insights to provide predictive risk assessments, landed cost optimization, and performance benchmarking. These capabilities empower businesses to make strategic decisions that can reduce costs and improve operational efficiency.\n\n**Inquire Before Buying@**[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry\\_Before\\_BuyingNew.asp?id=70680100](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=70680100&utm_campaign=trademanagementmarket&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=referral)\n\n**Top Companies in the Trade Management Market**\n\nKey and innovative vendors in the trade management market are Oracle (US), Infor (US), Thomson Reuters (US), Livingston International (Canada), Aptean (US), SAP (Germany), Noatum Logistics (Spain), E2open (US), Descartes (Canada), CargoWise (Australia), Expeditors (US), BDP International (US), Accuity (US), QAD Precision (US), 3rdwave (Canada), AEB (Germany), Shipsy (India), Bamboo Rose (US), Bolero International (UK), MIC Customs Solutions (UK), OCR Services (US), Webb Fontaine (UAE), Neurored (Spain), 4PL Consultancy (UK), Global Custom Compliance (China), Vigilant Global Trade Services (US), and Centrade (US).\n\nOracle offers goods and services that cover all facets of business IT, including platforms, applications, and infrastructures.

The dollar is coming off its worst annual performance since 2017, with analysts predicting another year of decline.\n\n\"The U.S. economy still looks pretty good. A lot of the positioning in short U.S. dollar has already been done, and I think that's going to prevent the dollar from getting significantly weaker going forward,\" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis.\n\n\"I think the winners could be some emerging market currencies more than the euro or the yen,” he added.\n\nTraders are pricing in at least two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year, although a divided central bank indicated in December there would be only one cut in 2026. The Fed is expected to keep rates steady at its meeting this month.\n\nMarkets have kept geopolitical concerns in the background, focusing on economic data instead.\n\nHowever, risks that President Donald Trump's administration could be forced to refund more than to importers if the U.S. Supreme Court this week declares his duties unlawful could resurface to hurt the dollar.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday the 2027 U.S. military budget should be $1.5 trillion, stoking some concerns about rising debt and a [higher risk premium](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-dip-defense-firms-climb-up-trump-budget-plans-2026-01-08/) on U.S. assets.\n\n## EURO ZONE DATA AND GREENLAND IN FOCUS\n\nOn the euro front, recent inflation figures drove the currency lower and German Bund yields to a one-month low.\n\nThe euro was down 0.05% at $1.1669 on Thursday, after dropping by 0.45% in the last two sessions.\n\n“Soft European inflation reinforces dovish sentiment, while the Greenland crisis underscores Europe’s relative vulnerability, potentially triggering further euro selling,” said Olivier Korber, foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Trump retained the option to address his objective to take over [Greenland by military means](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-move-greenland-2026-01-07/), while alarmed allies, including France and Germany, were working on a response.\n\nAnalysts flagged that the debate about changes in the European Central Bank policy shifted towards the possibility of a rate hike a year from now, while inflation is currently getting back to target with core edging lower.\n\nThe Japanese yen was roughly unchanged at 156.70 per U.S. dollar.\n\n\"For those hoping for a significant appreciation of the yen, the only option for now is to wait for the conflict with China to cool down again,\" said Michael Pfister, foreign exchange strategist at Commerzbank.\n\n“The Chinese government could further escalate the conflict with a complete export ban on rare earths, which would deal a significant blow to the yen,” he added.\n\n[Shares in Japanese chemical manufacturers fell](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-chemical-makers-fall-after-china-anti-dumping-probe-announcement-2026-01-08/) on Thursday while those of their Chinese rivals jumped after China said it was launching an anti-dumping probe into imports of chemicals used in chipmaking.\n\nThe Australian dollar eased to $0.6704, just below the 15-month high it touched earlier this week.\n\nReporting by Stefano Rebaudo and Sophie Kiderlin;

The sharp increase in tariffs imposed last year by the Trump administration may reduce inflation rather than increase it, according to research published Monday by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, suggesting that interest-rate cuts may be the proper policy response.\n\nU.S. imports were subject to an average 17% levy last year, up from less than 3% at the end of 2024 and the highest rate since 1935, according to Yale Budget Lab.\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Ftariffs-may-lower-inflation-sf-fed-research-suggests-2026-01-05%2F)\n\n\"Our analysis of historical data highlights a possibility that the large tariff increase of 2025 could put upward pressure on unemployment while putting downward pressure on inflation,\" researchers Regis Barnichon and Aayush Singh said in the regional Fed bank's latest Economic Letter, which builds on their working paper published in November.\n\nThe finding draws on 150 years of empirical data on the United States as well as France and the UK.\n\nThe Fed held rates steady for much of last year on concern that tariffs would add to inflation, as theoretical models as well as some empirical data suggested.\n\nBy September, signs of labor market weakness and a growing conviction that any inflationary boost from tariffs would be short-lived prompted the Fed to begin a string of rate cuts that lowered short-term borrowing costs by a total of 75 basis points in 2025.\n\nThe historical findings may not apply perfectly to today's economy, the San Francisco Fed researchers wrote, noting that U.S. manufacturing today relies more on imported products than it did in the past, meaning that tariffs may now be more likely to trigger higher inflation.\n\nEconomic uncertainty and a drop in stock prices, both of which typically coincide with large tariff shocks, may explain why higher import levies reduced inflation in the past, the researchers found.\n\nThey did not examine how that historical experience may have mapped to last year, when uncertainty by many measures rose sharply but major U.S. stock indexes also posted double-digit gains, fueling U.S. household spending and buoying the economy.\n\nReporting by Ann Saphir, Editing by William Maclean\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n## Read Next\n\n* [India's central bank to manage capital city's banking business, debt](/world/india/indias-central-bank-manage-capital-citys-banking-business-debt-2026-01-05/)\n* [Businesscategory](/business/)\n\n  [Apollo-led investors boost QXO's war chest as building-product deals heat up](/business/apollo-led-investors-commit-12-billion-building-products-firm-qxo-2026-01-05/)\n* [Morning Bid: Geopolitics take center stage in the new year](/world/china/global-markets-view-usa-2026-01-05/)\n* [Sustainabilitycategory](/sustainability/)\n\n  [China nudges banks to disclose lending ties with Venezuela, Bloomberg News reports](/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/china-nudges-banks-disclose-lending-ties-with-venezuela-bloomberg-news-reports-2026-01-05/)\n* [United Kingdomcategory](/world/uk/)\n\n  [UK consumer borrowing rises by most since November 2023](/world/uk/uk-mortgage-approvals-dip-november-consumer-borrowing-rises-2026-01-05/)\n\n## [Business](/business/)\n\n* ### [Italy closes probe into DeepSeek after commitments to warn of AI 'hallucination' risks](/world/china/italy-closes-probe-into-deepseek-after-commitments-warn-ai-hallucination-risks-2026-01-05/)\n\n  [category](/world/) · · ago\n\n  Italy’s antitrust authority has ended an investigation into the Chinese AI system DeepSeek for allegedly failing to warn users that it may produce false information, agreeing to binding commitments as a condition for closing the case.\n* [Sustainabilitycategory](/sustainability/)[Amazon must face price gouging lawsuit, US judge rules](/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/amazon-must-face-price-gouging-lawsuit-us-judge-rules-2026-01-05/)\n* [Businesscategory](/business/)[Canadian dollar lags G10 currencies on Venezuela uncertainty](/business/canadian-dollar-lags-g10-currencies-venezuela-uncertainty-2026-01-05/)\n* [Financecategory](/business/finance/)[Digital bank PicPay files for US IPO](/business/finance/digital-bank-picpay-files-us-ipo-2026-01-05/)\n* [category](/world/)[Dollar retreats with markets focused on US data, shrugging off Venezuela](/world/americas/dollar-firmer-venezuela-raid-hangs-over-sentiment-2026-01-05/)",

Any resemblances to actual future events are purely coincidental. This scenario is plausible, but certainly not inevitable. It is offered in the modest hope that it will inspire and inform efforts to prevent the disastrous outcome described here.\n\nIt is January 2028. Looking back, the Americans did not “take” Greenland—not in any concrete sense. There was no invasion, no purchase, not even a plebiscite. But in the shadowy corridors of Arctic politics, Washington moved deliberately to confound its opponents. The Americanization of Greenland transcended brute imperial force in the Russian mold.\n\nTwo years earlier, in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s showy military ouster of Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro—and Trump’s insistence that he intended to take over Greenland next—foreign policy analysts had been scrambling to imagine how he might seize the island. Would he force Denmark to sell its semiautonomous territory? Send in the troops, effectively attacking a NATO ally? But Trump didn’t have to do either. Instead, his administration pioneered a new form of twenty-first-century imperialism in which sovereignty over territory is imposed less by force than by function, through investments, contractors, and legal ambiguities. In the process, Trump’s Greenland gambit rewrote the rules of international order and created a template that Beijing, Moscow, and others soon followed. Now known as “geo-osmosis,” what follows is the story of how it happened.\n\n### **FROM TROLLING TO TRUTH**\n\nTrump originally floated the idea of acquiring Greenland in his first term. The 2019 revelation that he had inquired about purchasing the territory from Denmark was met with global bemusement and a curt “Greenland is not for sale” response from the Danish and Greenlandic governments. Few in Brussels, Copenhagen, or Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, took the threat seriously. After all, Trump had long trafficked in hyperbolic bombast.\n\nSeasoned Trump observers noted, however, that the idea of territorial acquisition had long held a special place in Trump’s worldview. Greenland grabbed Trump’s attention as “essentially, a big real estate deal,” as he put it, an accomplishment that the journalists Peter Baker and Susan Glasser note in a 2022 book “might give him a place in American history like William Seward’s purchase of Alaska from Russia.”\n\nEarly in his second term, Trump revived the proposal and gave it a geopolitical rationale. His argument that the United States should control Greenland had three pillars: It would help the country secure critical resources—the island is estimated to have enormous oil and gas reserves as well as troves of rare-earth minerals such as cobalt, graphite, and lithium. It would expand the U.S. military’s reach in the Arctic. And it would limit Chinese and Russian influence in a territory key to U.S. national security.\n\nBut when Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen offered to give the U.S. president more or less anything he wanted short of sovereignty to achieve those goals, Trump simply refused. It became clear that he was not actually interested in Arctic security. Rather, Greenland became the first in a series of Trumpian territorial ambitions that included Canada, the Panama Canal, and even the Gaza Strip—acquisitions that he apparently believed might secure his place on Mount Rushmore.\n\nAs was so often the case with Trump, it was difficult to separate the trolling from the truth. But it soon emerged that Greenland was a genuine target. With a more loyal second-term team ready to carry out his whims and a supine Congress, his administration was able to create a plan to make his desire a reality.\n\n### **ABSORB AND CONQUER**\n\nIn Greenland, the Trump administration lifted a few elements from its Venezuela template: for instance, the administration directed U.S. spy agencies to step up efforts to identify people in Greenland and Denmark who could support their objectives for the island, just as it leaned on the CIA to help overthrow Maduro. But Trump’s apparatchiks quickly concluded that the best way to control Greenland was not to follow the Venezuela model or to buy Greenland. Regardless of its immediate success, overt military action against a NATO ally would only ignite local and global opposition and limit the United States’ ability to assert sovereignty over the island. But they could control it by cleverly exploiting its supply dependencies.\n\nThe administration understood that Greenland was economically and politically fragile. At 56,000 people, its population was 500 times smaller than Venezuela’s. Manhattan’s East Village had more residents. A mostly uninhabitable ice sheet a quarter of the size of the U.S. mainland, its people were scattered and its infrastructure spotty; with only 93 miles of roads, many Greenlandic communities could reach the others only by boat, small plane, snowmobile, or dogsled, and less than 70 percent of the population used the Internet. Greenlanders had long resented Danish rule and accused the Danish government of keeping them poor and dependent. The island’s semiautonomous government, limited budgetary sovereignty, and simmering independence movement—most Greenlandic political parties ostensibly wanted the territory to gain full autonomy—made it highly susceptible to external influence. Add to this a thin institutional infrastructure and a lack of indigenous wealth, and you had an ideal laboratory for what Trump officials at the time termed “motivated alignment.”\n\nA planning cell in the White House began drafting what was euphemistically titled the Northern Strategic Realignment Initiative. With information from U.S. spy agencies in hand, in May 2026, the Trump administration announced a $10 billion “strategic development initiative” for Greenland, ostensibly to upgrade infrastructure and promote the exploitation of the island’s natural resources.\n\n> The Americans did not need the Greenlandic population’s consent.\n\nWashington moved through proxies. A patchwork of development consortiums, disaster response teams, nongovernmental organizations, consultants, and Arctic energy forums, almost all boasting loose ties to Trump-aligned donors or U.S. government funding, descended on Greenland in the summer of 2026. The activities of these polite people were ostensibly civilian: installing broadband, training local officials, or building roads, small airports, and health centers. Investment was deployed not nationally but municipally. Coastal communities received critical supplies, construction contracts, and digital infrastructure grants. The money came with no overt political strings, but it did have an accompanying series of technical agreements and memorandums that quietly shifted local loyalties and forced budgetary dependence.\n\nThis flurry of help and investment did not fool most Greenlanders. As early as January 2025, a survey jointly commissioned by Danish and Greenlandic newspapers showed that over 85 percent of the island’s residents opposed Greenland’s incorporation into the United States, and those numbers never changed very much. Greenlanders feared the erosion of their culture and autonomy, not to mention having to navigate the nightmare of the U.S. health-care system. But some of Greenland’s government officials and community leaders, long frustrated by Copenhagen’s paternalism and budget constraints, found themselves tempted by these American offers.\n\nThus, the U.S. efforts set the terms of Greenland’s next political phase. The Americans funded local media. They offered fellowships to emerging political leaders. Washington pushed a framing of Greenlandic identity in opposition to Danish “colonialism”—and as compatible with U.S. patronage. Ultimately, the Americans did not need the population’s consent. They just needed a few collaborators amid a general sense of fatigue and cynicism with politics as usual—an attitude Trump’s team is skilled at seeding.\n\n### **FEALTY FOLLOWS FUNCTION**\n\nThe sovereignty campaign was therefore not one of persuasion. It was one of circumvention and absorption. Trump’s advisers understood that Greenland’s democratic mechanisms could be rerouted by fragmenting the elite, creating greater economic dependence, and generating a need for emergency governance. Danish resupply routes began to face delays as ships were stopped and searched at sea. Fuel shortages, medical supply bottlenecks, and bureaucratic “miscommunications” caused by unexplained electricity and Internet outages pushed municipalities toward the only actors offering an alternative: the Americans.\n\nAround 150 U.S. service members had already been stationed at Pituffik Space Base in northern Greenland. But acting on humanitarian grounds, the U.S. military rapidly expanded its footprint. Emergency logistics hubs became new de facto bases. U.S. contractors took over local security training. By October, several Greenlandic lawmakers had formed a “Sovereign Future Caucus,” signaling their openness to “alternative security and economic partnerships.” One Trump adviser described it as “the Taiwan model in reverse: build deep ties first and let the sovereignty claims follow.”\n\nBy early 2027, Greenland was operating in a sovereignty twilight. Formally, it was still part of the Danish realm, but it had become functionally dependent on a U.S. presidential administration that had not even bothered to try to secure Greenlandic popular support.\n\n> Greenland’s democratic mechanisms could be rerouted.\n\nTo move from de facto integration toward de jure sovereignty, the U.S. Justice Department assembled a legal framework that invoked historical precedent. Drawing on the 1917 U.S. purchase of the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands), and citing Greenland’s right to self-determination under the UN Charter, Trump administration lawyers constructed what they called a sovereignty transition plan.\n\nThe Trump team avoided a national referendum, knowing it would fail. Instead, the administration encouraged the Greenlandic parliament to adopt a declaration of “provisional autonomy” and offered Washington’s recognition of Greenlandic sovereignty in principle. It was a phrase loaded with possibilities and devoid of obligations. A letter of support from pro-American Greenlandic officials, signed in July 2027, set the plan in motion. The U.S. then formally beganstationing U.S. security forces in Nuuk, using the letter to claim that they had been invited by the Greenlandic parliament, even though no vote had been held.\n\nIn October 2027, Greenland’s parliament declared provisional autonomy and an “interim sovereignty transition.” The United States raised its flag over new “civil-military liaison offices” in Nuuk and Greenland’s three next-largest towns. Negotiations to grant Greenland a compact of free association, akin to those the United States has with Micronesia or the Marshall Islands, began immediately afterward.\n\n### **EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN**\n\nThese efforts, of course, ignited a firestorm in Denmark. The Danish government declared the sovereignty transition plan a “hostile act” and withdrew its ambassador from Washington. The European Union denounced it as a violation of international law. The French president called it “a colonial anachronism wrapped in nationalist theatrics.” But Denmark had little military or economic leverage to wield. And the EU, more focused on managing other elements of its strained relationship with the United States, was unwilling to do anything beyond “monitoring the situation.”\n\nMeanwhile, Russian bombers conducted patrols near Greenlandic airspace. Chinese state media outlets declared the United States a “rogue imperialist actor,” even as many of their diplomats took notes. But these efforts only strengthened Trump’s case that the United States needed to control Greenland to protect it—and shore up U.S. national security.\n\nThe Greenland gambit divided American public opinion: MAGA conservatives hailed Trump’s move as a “strategic masterstroke,” while critics likened it to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and warned that the United States’ global credibility had suffered irreparably. But the administration’s media machine lurched into action, launching a public relations campaign called “America’s Frozen Frontier,” and Fox News aired segments with AI-generated images of Greenlandic children waving U.S. flags. Maps were redrawn. Trump rallies in Michigan and Pennsylvania featured chants of “Make Greenland Great Again.” The Trump Organization announced plans to make the island the “biggest, most beautiful winter resort” in human history, with fjord-based heli-skiing and extensive glamping opportunities.\n\nDenmark challenged the United States’ moves at the International Court of Justice, but the case languished in procedural purgatory, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed it as “nonsense.” Indigenous Greenlandic voices remained split: although some elites embraced U.S. investments, most residents warned of coming environmental degradation and cultural erasure. None of that mattered. U.S. contractors continued to deliver services. Washington concluded its association compact with Nuuk, assumed full authority over Greenland’s defense and security affairs, and asserted a claim that Greenland represented a U.S. “special economic zone.” Trump declared victory.\n\n### **THE COLD BENEATH THE ICE**\n\nDecades later, the Greenland gambit would be studied as the prototype for a new form of state expansion, one that blurs the lines between consent, coercion, and capitulation. The Trump administration showed that territory need not be seized when it can be absorbed. It affirmed a simple truth of twenty-first-century geopolitics: in the absence of coherent international resistance, norms matter little; facts on the ground suffice. Commentators drew a direct line from the Trump team’s effort in Greenland to the later Russian absorption of Georgia and, of course, the Chinese takeover of Taiwan.\n\nIt also redefined the nature of international order and sovereignty. Manufactured dependence was no longer considered a form of imperialism; they became a method for building fraternal ties. Indigenous populations no longer determined sovereignty; supply chains did.

She added that his team is weighing a range of options — including the possibility of using military force.\n\nChinese authorities have [pushed back](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202601/t20260105_11806736.html). On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized Washington for \"using the so-called 'China threat' as a pretext for itself to seek selfish gains.\"\n\n## Frozen frontiers\n\nChina described itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in its [2018 official Arctic Policy](https://english.www.gov.cn/archive/white_paper/2018/01/26/content_281476026660336.htm), asserting its right to use resources and develop shipping routes in the Arctic.\n\nState-linked Chinese firms have also invested heavily in Arctic energy projects and developed maritime routes that could reduce shipping times between Asia and Europe.\n\n\"China would push back hard against any U.S. move to take control of Greenland, given Beijing's commercial interests on the island — from resource exploration to the security of Arctic shipping routes,\" said Xinbo Wu, director at the Center for American Studies at Shanghai-based Fudan University.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department [has identified China and Russia as key competitors](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3855787/now-the-hard-part-implementing-arctic-strategy/) in the region, pointing to their expanded military capabilities and joint naval patrols as risks to national security.\n\nBeijing could seek to raise costs for Washington through multilateral diplomacy and may deepen military cooperation with Russia in the Arctic region to deter the U.S., Wu said.\n\n\"We are really getting into uncharted territory and we have to be extremely careful,\" said Henry Wang, founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization, a think-tank that often aligns with Beijing's thinking.\n\n\"The international community has to work together now and probably stop this kind of unilateral approach.\"\n\n## Energy, rare earths, infrastructure\n\nBeijing's main interests in Greenland mirror those of the U.S.: [rare earths](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/greenland-rare-earths-us-china-processing-reality-mining-arctic-shipping-lanes-route-critical-minerals.html), uranium and zinc, said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group.\n\nGreenland, a vast and sparsely populated autonomous Danish territory, hosts several large rare-earth element deposits, with some discovered mines ranking [among the world's largest](https://eng.geus.dk/media/13174/go29.pdf). These minerals are crucial for high-tech industries, from electric vehicles to defense equipment.\n\nBesides the U.S. and China, the [European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6166) has also tried to secure access to these critical mineral supplies.\n\nChinese investors have grown \"much more cautious\" about Greenland in recent years amid rising geopolitical uncertainty, said Patrik Andersson, an analyst at the Swedish National China Center at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs.\n\nDenmark retains the legal authority to block foreign investments on national security grounds.\n\nIn 2016, a Hong Kong-linked firm attempted to acquire a former Danish naval base and related port facilities, prompting Copenhagen to block the sale. A Chinese state-owned firm also withdrew its bid for an airport construction contract worth 3.6 billion Danish kroner ($563 million) in 2019 after Greenland chose Denmark over Beijing to finance the project.\n\nAndersson noted that in some cases, Chinese interest in Greenland's minerals appeared to have already declined before the recent rise in geopolitical risk, in part due to the high costs of operating in Greenland.\n\n\"From a commercial standpoint, Chinese investors may see more attractive opportunities elsewhere,\" he added.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO6:3606:36\n\nTrump's Greenland ambitions are a wake up call: Chinese think tank\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nSome Chinese-backed projects in Greenland have also stalled over environmental concerns.\n\nChinese state-affiliated company [Shenghe Resources](/quotes/392-SZ/) acquired a stake in [the Kvanefjeld project in south](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2020/presence-before-power/4-greenland-what-is-china-doing-there-and-why/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20Kvanefjeld,Kvanefjeld%20site.%EF%BB%BF%5B75%5D)[ern Greenland in 2016](https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20161031/pdf/43ch5gzhvhrmhq.pdf). The project, which was set to become one of the world's largest rare-earth and uranium mines, was halted after Greenland [reinstated a ban](https://archive.is/3cbEl) on uranium mining in 2021.\n\nWhile some analysts have estimated Chinese investments in the Arctic at over $90 billion and described them as \"unconstrained,\" Harvard University's Kennedy School said the figures are \"highly exaggerated\" because they included failed investments and unbuilt projects.\n\nAccording to [Harvard's estimates](https://www.belfercenter.org/research-analysis/china-arctic-investments) in June 2025, most of the mineral, oil and gas resource projects in Greenland with Chinese backing had been paused or canceled.\n\nDespite those setbacks, Greenland [opened its representation office in Beijing in 2023](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-10-28/VHJhbnNjcmlwdDc1NTc3/index.html) as the Arctic country sought to deepen ties with Beijing.\n\n## 'Polar Silk Road'\n\nChina has eyes on new shipping routes opening up as melting ice opens shorter paths between Asia and Europe. China's exports to the European Union, its second-largest trading bloc, [grew 8.1% year-on-year](http://www.customs.gov.cn/customs/2025-12/08/article_2025122717403341061.html) in the first eleven months of 2025.\n\nBeijing formally introduced the \"Polar Silk Road\" in its 2018 Arctic policy white paper and launched its [first Arctic shipping route to Europe](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202509/1344211.shtml) in September 2025, cutting transit times to about 20 days, roughly half the time needed for a journey through [the Suez Canal](https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/p/0P9505FV.html).\n\nThe alternative sea route presents not only \"immense economic opportunities\" for Beijing through faster trade and access to untapped natural resources, but also a \"strategic challenge to the United States' dominance of global sea lanes,\" said Zoha Fatima, a researcher focused on Arctic governance and geopolitics.\n\nChina has also expanded Arctic research efforts over the years, supporting discoveries related to sea ice composition, space weather and marine life.\n\nBuilding on existing projects in Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland, China has also [planned a research](https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/online-analysis/2020/02/china-arctic/) and satellite ground station in Greenland.\n\nThese facilities are crucial for China's Beidou navigation satellite system, developed as an alternative to the U.S.'s GPS system.\n\nChina's polar research programs have raised security concerns in the Arctic. In 2022, the Biden administration [asserted that](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/National-Strategy-for-the-Arctic-Region.pdf) China used its scientific engagements to conduct \"dual-use research with intelligence or military applications.\"\n\n\"If Trump were to take Greenland, Beijing would frame this as U.S. unilateralism and North Atlantic militarization, while stressing respect for Danish-Greenlandic autonomy and UN-based rules,\" said Eurasia's Wang.\n\n*— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng, Emily Tan contributed to this story.*",

But the crisis has exposed an uncomfortable reality - Denmark is [rallying support](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-move-greenland-2026-01-07/) to protect a territory whose population wants independence, and whose largest opposition party now wants to bypass Copenhagen and [negotiate directly with Washington](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-should-hold-talks-with-us-without-denmark-opposition-leader-says-2026-01-08/).\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fdenmarks-greenland-dilemma-defending-territory-already-its-way-out-2026-01-10%2F)\n\n\"Denmark risks exhausting its foreign policy capital to secure Greenland, only to watch it walk away afterwards,\" said Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen, a political science professor at University of Copenhagen.\n\n## STRATEGIC RELEVANCE\n\nDenmark cannot let Greenland go without losing its [geopolitical relevance](https://www.reuters.com/world/why-does-trump-want-greenland-could-he-get-it-2025-01-08/) in the [Arctic territory](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GREENLAND-ELECTION/MAPS/zjvqaeledvx/), strategically located between Europe and North America and a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system.\n\nYet it may ultimately have nothing to show for its efforts if [Greenlanders choose independence](https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland/) - or strike their own deal with Washington.\n\nThe stakes extend beyond Denmark's national interests. European allies have rallied behind Denmark not just out of solidarity, but because giving up Greenland would set a dangerous precedent that could embolden other powers to pursue territorial claims against smaller nations, upending the post-1945 world order.\n\nDenmark's foreign ministry declined to comment, but referred to joint remarks by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on December 22.\n\n\"National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,\" the two leaders said. \"They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country ... Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.\"\n\nThis week, Frederiksen said: \"If the U.S. chooses to attack another NATO country, everything stops, including NATO and the security the alliance has provided since World War Two.\"\n\n## THE 'GREENLAND CARD'\n\nFor now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table, including buying the territory or taking it by force.\n\nCopenhagen professor Rasmussen said any discussion of whether holding on to Greenland is worth the cost has been drowned out by outrage at Trump's threats.\n\n\"It is not part of the political debate in Denmark. I fear we have gone into patriotic overdrive,\" he said.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Greenland's strategic location gave Denmark outsized influence in Washington and allowed it to maintain lower defence spending than would otherwise be expected of a NATO ally.\n\nThis became known as \"the Greenland Card\", according to a 2017 report by the University of Copenhagen's Centre for Military Studies.\n\nBut Greenland's aspirations for self-determination have been brewing since the former colony got greater autonomy and its own parliament in 1979. A 2009 agreement explicitly recognised Greenlanders' right to independence if they choose.\n\nAll Greenlandic parties say they want independence, but differ on how, and when, to achieve it.\n\nTrump's pressure has accelerated a timeline that was already in motion, forcing Copenhagen to spend political capital and financial resources on a relationship with an increasingly uncertain endpoint.\n\n\"How much should we fight for someone who doesn't really care about us?\" Joachim B. Olsen, a political commentator and former Danish lawmaker, told Reuters.\n\n## THE FINANCIAL BURDEN\n\nCopenhagen provides an annual block grant of roughly 4.3 billion Danish crowns ($610 million) to Greenland's economy, which is near stagnation with GDP growth of just 0.2% in 2025.\n\nThe central bank estimates an annual financing gap of approximately 800 million Danish crowns to make current public finances sustainable. Denmark also covers police, the justice system and defence - bringing total annual spending to just under $1 billion.\n\nIn addition, Copenhagen last year announced a 42 billion Danish crowns ($6.54 billion) [Arctic defence package](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/denmark-boost-arctic-defence-by-426-billion-greenland-government-says-2025-10-10/) in response to U.S. criticism that Denmark has not done enough to protect Greenland.\n\nSome reject framing the relationship in [transactional terms](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/can-us-put-price-tag-greenland-2026-01-09/), pointing to Denmark's legal and moral obligations under international law and centuries of shared history.\n\n\"We're talking about family relations, long history of relations between Denmark and Greenland,\" said Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. \"So this is much more, it's not just about defence and economy, it's about feelings, it's about culture.\"\n\n## DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT\n\nPrime Minister Frederiksen faces a difficult balancing act, said Serafima Andreeva, researcher at Oslo-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute.\n\nFor now, Denmark has little choice but to stand firm to maintain its diplomatic credibility, but in doing so risks the relationship with the United States at a time \"when Russia is an accelerating threat and being on the U.S.'s bad side is no good for anyone in the West\".\n\nFrederiksen also faces an election this year, though Greenland has not been a major theme.\n\n\"I don't understand why we have to cling to this community with Greenland when they so badly want out of it,\" Lone Frank, a Danish science writer and broadcaster, told Reuters. \"To be completely honest, Greenland doesn't inspire any sense of belonging in me.\"\n\nReporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen; additional reporting by Soren Sirich Jeppesen and Tom Little; Editing by Alex Richardson\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen](/authors/jacob-gronholt-pedersen/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nBased in Copenhagen, Jacob oversees reporting from Denmark, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

As for other global powers, while [Russia is conspicuously quiet](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/russia-moscow-reaction-trump-greenland-takeover-ambitions.html) — probably because it is more interested in seeing any division in NATO over this affair — [China is keenly watching developments](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/us-trump-china-greenland-denmark-arctic-tensions-trump-rare-earth-elements-minerals-mining.html), having described itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in 2018. Any transaction — or operation — on this scale will have global repercussions.\n\n## What you need to know today\n\n**U.S. considering investing in mining projects in Greenland.** Amaroq, which operates on the island, said the White House is talking to it about [investment in its projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/-greenland-critical-minerals-mining-amaroq-us-government.html) that extract or explore gold, gallium and other critical mineral deposits.\n\n**Trump administration races to come up with Greenland takeover plan.** U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubiois set to [meet Denmark officials](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/greenland-rubio-denmark-trump.html) next week to discuss the situation. Here are [four key issues surrounding](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/greenland-trump-takeover-bid-denmark-what-happens-next.html) the meeting.\n\n**Chinese inflation accelerates in December.** The country's [consumer price index rose 0.8%](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/china-december-inflation-cpi-ppi-prices-demand-weakness.html) from a year earlier, as expected by a Reuters poll of economists. That's the highest level since Feb. 2023. However, inflation was flat for 2025 as a whole.\n\n**Divergence between U.S. indexes.** The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/quotes/.DJI/) roseThursday but the [Nasdaq Composite](/quotes/.IXIC/) slid as [investors rotated out of tech](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html). [Asia-Pacific markets mostly advanced](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/asia-pacific-markets-china-cpi-hang-seng-index-kospi-nikkei-225.html) Friday. Australia's [Rio Tinto](/quotes/RIO-AU/) had its worst day since 2022 on news it had entered buyout talks with [Glencore](/quotes/GLEN-GB/). Meanwhile, Asian defense stocks broadly climbed.\n\n**[PRO] Venezuela bond bets pay off.** Lee Robinson, founder and chief investment officer of distressed debt investor Altana Wealth, captured returns of 30% in Venezuelan bonds after the U.S. attack on the country. Robinson said there's [\"more upside\" to come.](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/venezuela-maduro-oil-trump-overthrow-russia-china-hedge-fund.html)\n\n## And finally...\n\n[**Trump is desperate to take Greenland. Can NATO defend itself — and is it willing to?**](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/nato-trump-greenland-war-invade-defense.html)\n\nEurope spent much of 2025 scrambling to bolster its defenses against Russia — but just a week into the new year, it's being forced to rethink security once again amid U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to annex Greenland.\n\nOn Monday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned an American takeover of Greenland would spell the end of NATO. Of NATO's 32 members, 23 – including Denmark – are also members of the European Union, which has been working extensively to ensure Trump's administration continues its [support for Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/12/ukraine-war-trump-frustrated-amid-warning-putin-can-escalate-conflict.html).\n\n*— Chloe Taylor*\n\nGet the CNBC Daily Open report in your inbox every morning and keep up to date with the markets wherever you are.\n\n[APAC Edition](https://www.cnbc.com/newsletter/daily-open-apac/) [EMEA Edition](https://www.cnbc.com/newsletter/daily-open-emea/)\n\n## [More In Daily Open](https://www.cnbc.com/daily-open/)\n\n[CNBC Daily Open: U.S. moves over Greenland are heating up quickly](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/cnbc-daily-open-us-moves-over-greenland-are-heating-up-quickly.html)\n\n[Yeo Boon Ping](https://www.cnbc.com/yeo-boon-ping/)\n\n[CNBC Daily Open: Magnificent Seven competition heats up](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/cnbc-daily-open-magnificent-seven-competition-heats-up.html)\n\n[Yeo Boon Ping](https://www.cnbc.com/yeo-boon-ping/)\n\n[CNBC Daily Open: Rumbles within the Magnificent Seven](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/cnbc-daily-open-rumbles-within-the-magnificent-seven.html)\n\n[Yeo Boon Ping](https://www.cnbc.com/yeo-boon-ping/)\n\n[Read More](https://www.cnbc.com/daily-open/ \"Read More\")",

Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nThere have been some legislative efforts in Congress to pursue such a proposal but they are yet to become law and in his post Trump did not offer explicit support to any specific bill.\n\nOpposition lawmakers have criticized Trump, a Republican, for failing to deliver on his campaign pledge.\n\n\"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, without providing more details.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies,\" Trump added.\n\nU.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat in the Senate Banking Committee, said Trump's call was meaningless without a bill being passed by Congress.\n\n\"Begging credit card companies to play nice is a joke. I said a year ago if Trump was serious, I'd work to pass a bill to cap rates,\" Warren said, while criticizing Trump's attempts to gut the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on details of the call from Trump, but said on social media without elaborating that the president was capping the rates.\n\nSome major U.S. banks and credit card issuers like [American Express](/quotes/AXP/), [Capital One Financial](/quotes/COF/), [JPMorgan Chase](/quotes/JPM/), [Citigroup](/quotes/C/) and [Bank of America](/quotes/BAC/) did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome banking advocacy groups said in a joint statement that a 10% interest rate cap would \"reduce credit availability\" and \"only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.\"\n\nThe statement came from the Consumer Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum and Independent Community Bankers of America.\n\n## Lawmakers have raised concerns about rates\n\nIndependent U.S. Sen [Bernie Sanders](https://www.cnbc.com/bernie-sanders/) of Vermont, a fierce Trump critic, and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a Republican, have previously introduced bipartisan legislation to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for five years. This bill explicitly directs credit card companies to limit rates as part of broader consumer relief legislation.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida have also introduced a bill in the House to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, reflecting cross-aisle interest in addressing high rates.\n\nBillionaire fund manager [Bill Ackman](https://www.cnbc.com/bill-ackman/), who endorsed Trump in the last elections, said on X the U.S. president's call was a \"mistake.\"\n\nLast year, the Trump administration moved to scrap a credit card late fee rule from the era of former President [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/).\n\nThe Trump administration had asked a federal court to throw out a regulation capping credit card late fees at $8, saying it agreed with business and banking groups that alleged the rule was illegal. A federal judge subsequently threw out the rule.",

They rely on the extra interest income to offset losses when some cardholders default, making it harder to lend profitably to riskier customers.\n\n\"We estimate it would swing the business to unprofitable if enacted, with subprime credit cards hardest hit,\" Truist Securities wrote in a note.\n\nIn a joint statement, banking industry bodies said the move will hurt \"millions of American families and small business owners.\"\n\n## HOW WILL BANKS AND CONSUMER LENDERS BE IMPACTED?\n\nFor banks and consumer lenders, an interest-rate cap would cut into one of their most profitable lending businesses. Credit card interest rates can climb as high as 30%, compared with an average rate just above 6% on a 30-year fixed mortgage, according to Bankrate.\n\nA rate cap could wipe out billions of dollars in interest income for banks and card issuers, analysts say, forcing lenders to rethink the scale and pricing of their card businesses.\n\n\"If this were to be enacted, there will be material headwinds to card profitability and likely result in card issuers tightening credit boxes meaningfully, particularly to high-risk borrowers,\" analysts at Barclays said.\n\n## WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM A CAP ON CREDIT CARD INTEREST RATES?\n\nA tightening of credit in a heavily regulated banking sector could push some consumers, particularly subprime borrowers, toward buy-now, pay-later providers, pawn shops and even loan sharks.\n\n\"This rate cap would not address the root of the problem and could push consumers towards more expensive debt if the cap does not apply to other unsecured consumer products,\" J.P. Morgan analysts said.\n\n\"It could push more borrowing away from banks into other unsecured loans such as pawn shops and other non-bank consumer lenders.\"\n\nBorrowing from the less regulated parts of the credit market would increase risks for consumers already under financial strain.\n\nBuy-now, pay-later services, which typically earn money from merchants rather than charging interest to consumers, have surged in popularity in recent years, particularly among younger borrowers, and could benefit if banks rein in credit card lending.\n\nReporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Manya Saini](/authors/manya-saini/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nManya reports on prominent publicly listed U.S. financial firms, including Wall Street’s biggest banks, card companies, asset managers, and fintechs.

Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nThere have been some legislative efforts in Congress to pursue such a proposal but they are yet to become law and in his post Trump did not offer explicit support to any specific bill.\n\nOpposition lawmakers have criticized Trump, a Republican, for not having delivered on his campaign pledge.\n\n\"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, without providing more details.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies,\" Trump added.\n\nU.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat in the Senate Banking Committee, said Trump's call was meaningless without a bill being passed by Congress.\n\n\"Begging credit card companies to play nice is a joke.

Production unwound amid the OPEC embargo and the nationalization of the country's oil industry under Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA).\n\nVolumes recovered in the late twentieth century before declining during the presidencies of Hugo Chávez and Nicolas Maduro, reaching a low of around 665,000 bpd in 2021 after the U.S. placed sanctions on PDVSA.\n\nToday's events to watch\n\n\\* U.S. initial jobless claims (8:30 AM EDT), trade deficit (8:30 AM EDT), Q3 productivity (8:30 AM EDT), consumer credit (3:00 PM EDT)\\* U.S. corporate earnings: Acuity Brands, Commercial Metals, Greenbrier Companies, Lindsay Corp, RPM International, TD Synnex\n\nWant to receive the Morning Bid in your inbox every weekday morning?

The [gauges both dropped yesterday](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/global-stocks-markets-dow-news-01-07-2026-9ca6a8eb), breaking a 2026 start-of-the-year rally.\n\nTrump called late Wednesday for a military budget of $1.5 trillion, more than $500 billion more than the Pentagon is expected to receive this fiscal year. [Defense stocks jumped](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-01-08-2026/card/defense-stocks-jump-after-trump-calls-for-1-5-trillion-defense-budget-d2L6xw0T00YQOR9eZBd2) in early premarket trading, with Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and RTX each rising about 5% or more. European weapons makers also rallied.\n\nTrump's announcement on social media followed a series of posts that knocked defense stocks earlier Wednesday. The president also moved to ban large institutional investors from [buying single-family homes](https://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/trump-housing-large-investor-single-family-home-ban-13e06f61).\n\nOil prices rose Thursday, with Brent crude futures topping $60 a barrel. Overnight, [The Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/trump-venezuela-oil-us-control-plan-265a39c1) that the White House is planning a sweeping initiative to dominate the Venezuelan oil industry for years to come, which Trump believes could lower cut prices to $50 a barrel. Meantime, the U.S. has accelerated its campaign against [shadow-fleet tankers shipping Venezuelan crude](https://www.wsj.com/world/u-s-forces-launch-operation-to-seize-fleeing-oil-tanker-0d6443ab).\n\nLater today, investors will get readouts on jobless claims and the trade deficit.

The deal could initially require cargoes that were ⁠bound for China to be rerouted. Venezuela could be seeking to unload millions of barrels of oil that are stranded in tankers and storage facilities to avoid additional escalation with the United States.\n\nTrump had demanded that Venezuela open up to U.S. oil companies or risk escalating military intervention. After that, U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro at the weekend.\n\nAnalysts say the agreement would keep prices low in an oversupplied market.\n\n\"Venezuela's oil exports to the United States have first and foremost disrupted the U.S. market, which will also deepen the global oversupply,\" said Yang An, an analyst at Haitong Futures.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts estimated the oil market could reach a ‍surplus of as many as 3 million barrels per day in ‌the first half of 2026, based on weak growth in ⁠demand last year and rising supply from OPEC and non-OPEC producers.\n\nHowever, the prospect of higher, cheaply extracted Venezuelan oil exports could pause ‍expansion of productive capacity in the U.S. and elsewhere, analysts at BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, said in a note on Wednesday.\n\nVenezuela has been selling its flagship crude grade, Merey, at around $22 per barrel below Brent for delivery at its ports.\n\n\"That raises the expected price of ⁠oil over the medium term, especially if ‌the Venezuelan regime survives,\" the BMI analysts said.",

If the U.S. were to lift sanctions on Venezuelan oil it could release barrels “and only add to the surplus that the market is already experiencing,” says Mizuho’s Robert Yawger. A substantial increase in Venezuelan production is widely expected to be a long-term prospect, although from around 1 million barrels a day at present “Venezuela could get to 1.5 million rather quickly,” Yawger says. “And I think Gulf coast refiners would be happy to take those barrels.” WTI settles down 2% at $57.13 a barrel, compared with $57.32 Friday. Brent falls 1.7% to $60.70 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com) [...] ### Crude Futures Ease Back From Early Gains\n\n1057 ET – Oil futures relinquish early gains with the market still weighing the implications of developments in Venezuela, while concerns about oversupply in 2026 remain. The ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro may have briefly camouflaged those concerns, but “I suspect the veil is going to be lifted again,” says Societe Generale’s Ben Hoff. “We’re going to have to face the hard reality that we are looking at a wall of crude heading onshore, something I think has been on people’s minds,” he adds. Crude’s move higher in the wake of the U.S. operation to remove Maduro was “more short-term market sentiment than anything fundamental,” he says. WTI is off 0.1% at $58.26 a barrel and Brent is near flat at $61.75.(anthony.harrup@wsj.com)",

Producers across the U.S. have watched the best drilling locations dry up and breakeven prices rise.\n\n\"$50 oil is really where production would start to fall,\" said Matthew Bernstein, Vice President, North America oil and gas at Rystad Energy.\n\nRystad sees onshore U.S. output, excluding Alaska, declining by around 150,000 bpd through 2026 in a $50 price environment.\n\nTechnological improvements have allowed drillers to eke out more oil at lower prices, but some analysts and industry participants have warned those improvements may be approaching their limit.\n\nThe OPEC+ producer group opted to pause production target increases for the first quarter of 2026, amid ample global supplies. OPEC could, however, start increasing output again as it seeks to take market share from U.S. shale producers.\n\nRedirecting Venezuelan barrels into the U.S. market is part of a broader effort to combat inflation by pressuring oil prices, Michael Alfaro, CIO of Gallo Partners, a regulatory - and policy-focused hedge fund said. While Trump is supportive of U.S. shale in principle, lower oil prices combined with steel tariffs, are two persistent headwinds for this group, he added.\n\n\"I’m very much in a wait-and-see mode because there are still big unanswered questions,\" said Mike Oestmann, CEO of shale producer Tall City Exploration in the Permian Basin.\n\nReporting by Georgina McCartney and Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; Editing by Liz Hampton, Simon Webb and Diane Craft\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Arathy Somasekhar](/authors/arathy-somasekhar/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nHouston-based energy reporter focused on oil markets and energy companies.

Points\n\n* Tech gains remain too small to offset China’s deep and persistent property downturn, Rhodium Group said.\n* Real estate weakness and automation threaten jobs and future growth targets.\n* Greater reliance on exports raises exposure to tariffs and trade tensions, Rhodium added.\n\nA tower crane stands above residential buildings in an urban district in the afternoon light, on January 9, 2026, in Chongqing, China.\n\nCheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING — China's push into high-tech industries isn't large enough to offset the country's property slump, leaving the economy more exposed to trade tensions, U.S.-based research firm Rhodium Group said in a report Monday.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2025, new industries such as artificial intelligence, robotics and electric cars added just 0.8 percentage points to economic output, while real estate and other traditional sectors saw a combined 6 percentage point decline, the report said. The analysis drew on official Chinese data and industry-specific sources.\n\nThe findings come as China seeks to boost technological self-reliance in response to U.S. restrictions. Under a five-year development plan set to kick off in earnest in March, [Beijing is doubling down on advanced technologies](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/china-to-bolster-consumption-tech-development-as-us-tensions-simmer.html) with state investment and favorable policies.\n\n\"China's growth strategy isn't going to work,\" Logan Wright, partner at Rhodium and a co-author of the report, told CNBC. \"They're not going to achieve their targeted rates of GDP growth based on the policies they have outlined so far.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO8:0408:04\n\nMorgan Stanley sees 'year of stabilization' for China markets after strong 2025\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nBeijing has targeted annual GDP growth of around 5% in recent years. For China to sustain that pace, new industries would need to expand sevenfold over the next five years to generate the roughly 2 percentage points of annual investment growth required, Rhodium estimated.\n\nThat translates to an additional 2.8 trillion yuan in new investment required this year — or 120% more than in 2025. While investment in artificial intelligence or robotics could increase in the next year or two, other emerging industries are unlikely to sustain such rapid growth, the analysts said.\n\n\"Electric vehicles have likely already reached their fastest rates of growth, and output in the industry may be slowing in the years ahead,\" the Rhodium report said.\n\n## Property drag deepens\n\nWhile Beijing has prioritized [high-tech development](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/10/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-a-rival-ai-strategy.html), it has taken fewer steps to address a yearslong slump in real estate. The sector [once accounted for more than a quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/09/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-the-hidden-drag-on-chinas-economy.html) of the economy. New home sales by floor area last year fell to levels [not seen since 2009](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-dcid0mnIi8knATU9vEyWg), according to a report last week by the China Real Estate Information Corp.\n\nOnly in recent weeks have sighs appeared that some policymakers are [considering more forceful property support](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/china-property-slump-policy-shift-qiushi-2026-ahead-march-meeting.html). China's top leaders are due to formalize economic targets for the year at an annual parliamentary meeting in March.\n\nA macro outlook published by global investment firm KKR estimated that property weakness will shave 1.2 percentage points off China's GDP growth this year. Even with a projected 2.6 percentage point contribution from digital technologies, the estimated total growth was still on the low end at 4.6%.\n\n\"Despite a potential 5% growth target for 2026, headwinds from real estate and a weak job market cast doubt on achievability,\" the report said. KKR predicts the property drag could halve in 2027, but sees limited improvement in digital industries or consumer demand.\n\n## From jobs to trade tensions\n\nAn overemphasis on tech could have broader economic consequences.\n\nNew industrial sectors may offer higher wages, but they employ far fewer people than traditional industries, the Rhodium analysis found.\n\nIncreased factory automation, coupled with China's already high 30% share of global manufacturing output, could lead to the loss of up to 100 million jobs over the next decade — a displacement that would exceed the total workforce of most developed economies, KKR said.\n\nChina's urban unemployment rate remained [above 5%](http://english.scio.gov.cn/pressroom/2025-12/15/content_118228465.html) for much of last year, while youth unemployment has been [about three times higher.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/17/china-youth-unemployment-civil-service-jobs-economy-slowdown.html)\n\nSince it's unlikely that domestic investment, even in newer industries, will produce sufficient demand, \"Beijing will become even more dependent upon gaining market share in export markets,\" the Rhodium report said.\n\n\"China will remain even more reliant upon exports in the future, leaving the economy vulnerable to new trade restrictions,\" the report said.\n\nAs lower-priced Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, have expanded overseas, Mexico and the European Union have joined the U.S. in raising tariffs on imports from China.\n\nWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox  \n [Subscribe now](https://www.cnbc.com/lander?id=chinaconnection-newsletter)\n\nChina's economic imbalance mirrors a similar [divergence in the U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/25/ai-spending-is-boosting-the-economy-many-businesses-in-survival-mode.html), where AI-linked companies have led stock market gains, while [other parts of the economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/business/the-ai-boom-economy.html) have struggled.\n\nBut many in Beijing argue that the country has longer-term interests at stake.\n\nZhang Jianping, a deputy director at China's Commerce Ministry, told CNBC last week that the country's policies are designed to support innovation over multiple years. Traditional industries such as steel and real estate, he added, must integrate new technologies to remain competitive.",

His first stint came in 2007 and 2008, when Beijing hosted its first Olympic Games, and the financial crisis hit much of the world. He later served again in 2015 and 2016, as populist movements rose globally and gave Donald Trump his first term as U.S. President.\n\nFast forward a decade, and U.S. businesses have endured everything from the pandemic to escalating tariffs. But the past decade of what Zimmerman calls \"experimenting with competition\" could now give way to something new, with Trump expected to visit China in April.\n\nThis picture taken on November 6, 2018 shows a Chinese and US flag at a booth during the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai.\n\nJohannes Eisele | AFP | Getty Images\n\n*Here are the highlights of our conversation, with responses condensed for clarity:*\n\n**Why are you staying engaged at such a high level, after nearly 30 years in China?**\n\nThe reason I'm involved is because I think this is a very important year.\n\n2026 is important, not just because [it's] the 250th anniversary of the U.S., but the U.S. and China have had 10 years of experimenting with competition, experimenting with calls for decoupling and de-risking.\n\nHas that worked?

So it's now time to go back and, in a way that may be visionary, to get us back on track to have ongoing dialogues, ongoing engagement, because I think, at the end of the day, that will be in the best interest of the U.S. and China.\n\n**Are many U.S. companies decoupling from China?**\n\nNo. We're seeing an evolution. People are starting to adjust. For many sectors, China continues to be a critical market. But it's also an essential part of the global supply chain.\n\nAmerican companies are adjusting to this new normal within the U.S.-China relationship. But there has been some diversifying, and that's a healthy strategy that companies are looking at, but we are not seeing wholesale decoupling at all.\n\nIt's important that we have senior**-**level meetings that bring some clarity, some certainty, some continuity to the relationship.\n\nDialogue matters **—** even the smallest, positive signals, at the presidential level, on engagement are very, very important. Regular, ongoing engagement helps reduce any potential misunderstandings and lowers the risk of unexpected policy shocks, like the back-and-forth over tariffs.\n\n**What kind of opportunity do U.S. businesses have in China as domestic competition rises?**\n\nWe have our white paper, which, in a way, allows us to engage with the Chinese government to seek changes that are positive.\n\nProtection of intellectual property is not just an issue for foreign companies. It's also an issue for Chinese companies.\n\nBoth sides need to tone down the national security issues and not view every slight as a national security matter.\n\nWe can't have an environment where every foreigner is targeted as a potential threat. And that goes both ways: when Chinese companies go to the U.S., we can't take the view that it's a threat to the communities they want to operate in.\n\n**Is the CEO of the China operations losing influence on headquarters in the U.S.?**\n\nIt's something that needs further attention post-pandemic. But that's something that is just a circumstance, especially given what took place during the pandemic, when travel came to a halt.\n\nBut when you look at AmCham, the U.S.-China Business Council and the National Committee for U.S.-China Relations, there's now increased interest in making sure CEOs, academic leaders, as well as congressional leaders, travel to [China to] understand what the environment is all about.\n\nWe try to encourage more people-to-people exchanges. I'm going to be out and about in the community, emphasizing the importance of education as well as the arts. For example, I'm going to a conference at the Juilliard School in Tianjin.\n\n**What's on your agenda at AmCham China for 2026?**\n\nIn some respects**,** we're focused on April when President Trump is planning to come to China. We're hopeful that AmCham will be able to play a role in that. There is a focus on that, and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of work leading up to that visit.\n\nThere'll be some agreements, some understanding, maybe a memorandum of understanding that may come out of that.\n\nWe're not expecting a grand bargain. There just isn't enough time. It was last summer, and we were in the middle of a trade war. And only since October, President Xi, as well as President Trump, met in South Korea, have we started a process [around] let's meet, let's talk, let's keep engaging.\n\nSo I think we're on the right track, but we'll just have to see the progress between now and April. But we're optimistic the signals will come out positive. And again, any level of confidence that can be received from those meetings, I think, is very important to the business community.\n\nA lot of President Trump's predecessors were very visionary about what they viewed as the future of U.S.-China relations.\n\nAnd so, this year, we're hoping that President Trump will also be visionary and seek to move the relationship forward in a way that mutually benefits both the United States and China, its companies, consumers, workers and farmers.\n\n## Top TV picks on CNBC\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:3902:39\n\nUS-China tech co-dependence may grow in 2026: Eurasia Group\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nEurasia Group's Xiaomeng Lu explained why China's tech competition with the U.S. remains intense, but argued that tech co-dependence may expand in 2026, driven by easing export controls, cross-border deals, and the global uptake of Chinese open-source AI models.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO5:0905:09\n\nChina's property slump to persist as consumers shift to rentals: UBS\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nJohn Lam, head of China and Hong Kong property research at UBS Investment Bank, explained why he sees a 10% decline in property prices and new home sales in China for 2026.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO12:3712:37\n\nFantastical to think Venezuela event changed China's decades of Taiwan planning\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nEvan Feigenbaum from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said Venezuela isn't a core interest for China, but if the U.S. were to launch a second strike or a full-scale invasion, China would make \"a lot of hay rhetorically about international law.\"\n\n## Need to know\n\n**China condemns U.S. attack on Venezuela.** Beijing said it was \"[deeply shocked](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/china-response-us-venezuela-strike-economic-interests.html)\" by the U.S. strike on Venezuela Saturday and called for the release of leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife.\n\n**BYD tops Tesla worldwide.** The Chinese automaker officially [sold more](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/chinas-byd-to-overtake-tesla-as-worlds-top-ev-seller-for-first-time.html) battery-powered electric cars than Tesla in 2025 — at 2.26 million units.\n\n**Chinese companies hit Vegas.** Many Chinese humanoid robotic and consumer electronics companies are in Las Vegas this week to showcase their products at the [Consumer Electronics Show](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3338600/chinas-humanoid-robot-makers-hong-kong-start-ups-set-dazzle-ces-2026).\n\n## Quote of the week\n\nBetween the two countries in 2026, we are likely to see some tech co-dependence going on and even growing despite the broader trend of U.S.-China competition.\n\n— [*Xiaomeng Lu, director in Eurasia Group's geo-technology practice*](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/01/02/us-china-tech-co-dependence-may-grow-in-2026-eurasia-group.html)\n\n## In the markets\n\nOnshore Chinese stocks edged higher Wednesday, holding near four-year highs as Beijing continues to push development of its artificial intelligence sector.\n\nGoldman Sachs expects China's equity rally to continue into 2026, though at a slower pace.

McNeal](https://www.cnbc.com/dewardric-mcneal/)\n\n[WATCH LIVE](/live-tv/)\n\nKey Points\n\n* Trump's so-called \"Donroe Doctrine\" framing of Western Hemispheric dominance has led to concerns that China will move on Taiwan to flex its own regional muscle.\n* It is the wrong question to be asking given what has taken place in Venezuela, writes international policy expert Dewardric McNeal.\n* China sees itself as a global power with global interests, ambitions, investments, and supply-chain demands — with the agency to defend and extend those interests in America's so-called backyard.\n\nUS President Donald Trump shows a lapel pin as he speaks during a meeting with US oil companies executives in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on January 9, 2026.\n\nSaul Loeb | Afp | Getty Images\n\nThe conversation in Washington right now is abuzz with talk of [President Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)'s new National Security Strategy and its so-called \"Donroe Doctrine\" framing of Western Hemispheric dominance — a modern corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. That debate had already been simmering in policy circles before the end of last year, but it was turbocharged by the recent U.S. operation in Venezuela. Almost immediately, the familiar question resurfaced: What will China do now?\n\nMuch of that speculation has [fixated on Taiwan](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/us-venezuela-strike-taiwan-china-precedent-russia-ukraine.html). Would Beijing use U.S. kinetic action in Venezuela as justification — or precedent — for moving against the island? That question may be understandable and its implications concerning. However, many believe that it is also the wrong question to be asking.\n\nChina will not use Venezuela as a pretext to invade Taiwan. That is neither how Beijing thinks nor how it operates. Serious analysis demands setting the distraction of seeing China as a reactive power aside, and dealing with a more consequential — and far more uncomfortable — question. It requires that we read and debate China's own strategic documents about our region with the same rigor now being applied to the U.S. National Security Strategy, and take them seriously on their own terms.\n\n[China's newly issued](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202512/10/content_WS693962c3c6d00ca5f9a08069.html) third Policy Paper on Latin America and the Caribbean is not a press release or a reactive and reflexive impulse triggered by Washington. It is a longstanding, well thought out, forward-looking, and deliberately structured approach to achieving China's long-term goals. It includes the range of tools of statecraft that it intends to use, and the pathways through which it plans to sustain its influence. It is an institutional blueprint — dense with political mechanisms, financing pathways, commercial incentives, and a theory of the case for the legitimacy of its engagement and presence in the region rooted in Global South solidarity rather than overt claims of regional hegemony or 18th-century cosplay.\n\nThe [NSS](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf) is explicit about intent. It commits the United States to keeping the hemisphere free of \"hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets,\" ensuring access to \"key strategic locations,\" and denying non-hemispheric competitors' control over \"strategically vital assets.\" Venezuela, in that telling, becomes a proof point: evidence that Washington is prepared to act kinetically to alter political realities when it believes access, stability, or strategic positioning are at risk.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO13:2813:28\n\nBremmer: Trump will focus on increasing military power as it loses economically\n\n[Squawk Box Asia](https://www.cnbc.com/asia-squawk-box/)\n\nBut the Trump NSS also reveals a central analytical vulnerability. It implicitly assumes the United States can grant spheres of influence — cede a region here, consolidate one there — and that so-called \"regional powers\" will accept the arrangement. China does not see itself as a regional power. It sees itself as a global power with global interests, ambitions, investments, and supply-chain demands — and with the agency to defend and extend those interests in America's so-called backyard. The NSS can declare a corollary; it cannot declare away another major power's presence or objectives, particularly one as deeply embedded in the hemisphere as China already is. China's Latin America strategy is engineered to be resilient against exactly this kind of episodic shock.\n\n### How China exerts its influence across the globe\n\nStart with the political architecture. Beijing does not limit its engagement to trade or hydrocarbons, though both [matter a great deal to Beijing](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/china-response-us-venezuela-strike-economic-interests.html). Instead, it pursues head-of-state diplomacy, exchanges between intergovernmental committees, legislature-to-legislature exchanges, political-party engagement, and deep institutional embedding through CELAC, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, a 33-country regional political bloc coordinating cooperation across trade, finance, infrastructure, technology, and people-to-people ties. The objective is explicit: institutionalize influence across \"multi-level, multi-channel\" pathways with a structure that dilutes any single pressure point campaign by the United States. It is far harder to \"flip\" a region when influence runs so deeply through presidents, parties, parliaments, technocrats, students, consumers, and subnational actors simultaneously.\n\nThe economics reinforce that architecture. China frames its engagement — accurately or not — as co-production and co-dependence rather than exploitation or charity. The strategy emphasizes infrastructure connectivity, logistics management, digital infrastructure, smart cities, industrial parks, manufacturing cooperation, and export support. These projects create domestic constituencies: jobs, contracts, port throughput, wages, and broad political winners in the region. Financial cooperation sweetens the model further through local-currency settlement, RMB clearing arrangements, credit and debt swap lines, and even Panda bonds on offer. The aim is straightforward: reduce exposure to U.S. financial leverage, political pressure points, and sanctions risk over time.\n\nTrump's [push for U.S. oil companies to invest](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/what-the-big-oil-executives-told-trump-about-investing-in-venezuela.html) in Venezuela offered a series of security guarantees but surfaced a familiar constraint: executives emphasized that investment also hinges on long-term financing, risk-sharing, and enforceable contracts — support China routinely provides its firms through policy banks and export credits — while Washington has yet to signal a clear willingness to deploy comparable tools via the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation(DFC), Ex-Im Bank, or multilateral finance.\n\nAnd those financial support and assistance tools should not be pursued in a vacuum; when done well, they are designed to anchor influence in physical strategic assets — natural resources, ports, logistics hubs, energy infrastructure, and transit corridors — where economics and geopolitics inevitably intersect.\n\n### $500 billion in trade, Panama Canal confrontation\n\nScale matters. China-Latin America trade exceeded $500 billion in 2024, and the region represents more than 670 million consumers, many of whom are drawn to Chinese products on price, availability, and increasingly quality. These are not marginal markets. They are structural to China's global growth model and export strategy.\n\nBeijing is also candid — if selectively so — about its interest in strategic resources. Energy and critical minerals feature prominently, alongside language about long-term supply arrangements and local-currency pricing. Access spans the value chain from extraction to utilization. For U.S. policymakers, investors, and CEOs, this is the commercial backbone the NSS must contend with. This is not about nostalgia for the Monroe Doctrine; it is a 21st-century strategy designed to achieve many of the same outcomes through more modern means and more seductive rhetoric.\n\nThe Panama Canal brings these strategies into direct collision. China's policy paper treats ports, logistics, and maritime cooperation as first-order instruments of development and influence — and, in a crisis, as latent strategic assets to be exploited during a military confrontation with the regional hegemon (the U.S.). The NSS, meanwhile, explicitly flags \"key strategic locations\" and acknowledges how commercial infrastructure can be repurposed for military use. Panama — more than Venezuela — is where these approaches collide most sharply. [Ongoing debates over port concessions and terminal control](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/22/tanker-seizures-venezuela-oil-china.html) underscore that both Washington and Beijing view the canal itself and canal-adjacent assets as strategic, not merely commercial in nature.\n\nCrew members of Chinese Cosco Shipping Rose container ship wave Chinese and Panamenian flag before China's President Xi Jinping and Panama's Juan Carlso Varela, arrive at the Cocoli locks in the expanded Panama Canal, in Panama City, Panama on December 3, 2018.\n\nLuis Acosta | Afp | Getty Images\n\nSo, does U.S. action in Venezuela change the calculus? In the long run, no.\n\nIt will raise risk premiums for many — for Chinese firms, regional leaders, and global companies caught between compliance regimes, complicate logistics and supply chains, and further the weaponization of market access. It will push some governments to hedge more carefully, demand higher \"insurance\" from Beijing, or seek stronger economic and security assurances from Washington. But it does not erase the fundamentals of what China has spent two decades building: trade corridors, lending relationships, political networks, and now an explicit push into high-tech cooperation — from EVs, AI, and satellites to aerospace and digital trade, and aligning closely with where many Latin American economies want to go.\n\nZoom out one level further and the logic extends north. Greenland and the Arctic are not separate conversations; they are the same set of arguments, just on ice. Washington frames Greenland through minerals, shipping lanes, and military access. Beijing frames the Arctic as an international space with global stakes, governed by international law, where non-Arctic states have legitimate interests. If the U.S. believes spheres can be secured through doctrine plus decisive action, China's operating assumption is the opposite. It believes in focusing its pushback on arguments that the U.S. has used for decades to justify their presence in the Asia-Pacific region — that states have a right to the global commons, that big states have global interests that must be protected, and that a long-term and well establish persistent presence in a region must be respected. China takes these same positions with respect to Latin America and Greenland.\n\nThe action in Venezuela does show that the Trump administration is more serious than its predecessors about reasserting hemispheric dominance — and that the NSS is not merely rhetorical. But China will not be rushing for the exits in the Western Hemisphere. It is deeply entrenched. Smaller powers have agency too. They will not be dictated to without far richer incentives, protections, or more sustained pressure than a single special forces operation can provide.\n\nIf Washington wants a hemisphere that chooses the United States rather than submits to it, it must compete with China's full-stack approach: finance, infrastructure, technology, people-to-people exchange, affordable products, political access, and a compelling narrative of partnership. A declaration in an NSS and one dramatic operation are short-term events. China's engagement in Latin America is a long game, and the competition it sets in motion will be neither quick nor simple.\n\n—*By* [*Dewardric McNeal*](https://www.cnbc.com/dewardric-mcneal/)*, Managing Director and Senior Policy Analyst at Longview Global, and a CNBC Contributor*\n\n## [More In The Bottom Line](https://www.cnbc.com/global-cfo-council/)\n\n[The crypto ATM's days in America may be numbered](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/bitcoin-crypto-atm-scam-fraud-regulation.html)\n\n[Kevin Williams](https://www.cnbc.com/kevin-williams/)\n\n[Op-ed: China won the 2025 battle in Trump's trade war.

The Trade Management Market focuses on software and services that help organizations efficiently manage international trade operations, including compliance, documentation, customs filing, and tariff management. It supports businesses in navigating complex global trade regulations, reducing operational risks, and improving supply chain visibility.\n\n**Download PDF Brochure@**[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=70680100](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=70680100&utm_campaign=trademanagementmarket&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=referral)\n\n**Large Enterprises segment to have the highest market share during the forecast period**\n\nComplex trade operations are handled by large businesses in industries like consumer goods and retail, healthcare, aerospace and defence, and transportation and logistics. These businesses have a very robust and extensive network of regionally dispersed suppliers and partners. Large businesses handle the import and export of high-value items to and from many nations. Large firms are important players in the trade management market because they manage the extensive network and adhere to the rules to avoid harsh penalties.\n\n**Transportation and Logistics is expected have the highest market share during the forecast period**\n\nThe transportation and logistics industry has benefited greatly from rising globalisation. As new technologies streamline its basic processes, the transportation and logistics sector is undergoing a digital transition. The transportation and logistics sectors are under pressure to reduce operational costs and streamline trade procedures as a result of the expansion of global trade. Trade management tools give transportation and logistics organisations the visibility they need to oversee shipments and inventories and deliver dependable services.\n\n**North America region to record the highest market share in the trade management market**\n\nDuring the projected period, North America is anticipated to hold the biggest market share for trade management. North America, which is regarded as one of the most developed regions in terms of technology adoption and infrastructure, makes up the majority of GTM solutions and services. Another critical element supporting the expansion of the trade management sector is a robust infrastructure supporting international trade in this area. The expansion of the trade management market in North America is projected to be supported by significant investments in the aerospace and defence, healthcare, and life sciences sectors.\n\n**Request Sample Pages@**[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=70680100](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=70680100&utm_campaign=trademanagementmarket&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=referral)\n\n**Unique Features in the Trade Management Market**\n\nTrade management platforms come with built-in compliance engines that automatically update and enforce global trade regulations, tariff changes, sanctions lists, and restricted party screening. This reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and protects businesses from costly fines and shipment holds.\n\nOne of the standout features is real-time visibility into trade operations, including shipment tracking, customs clearance status, and documentation flow. This transparency enables quicker response to delays, exceptions, or disruptions across global supply chains.\n\nInnovative tools for tariff classification, duty drawback processing, free trade agreement (FTA) qualification, and duty optimization help companies reduce landed costs. These features empower users to strategically plan imports/exports and maximize cost savings.\n\nTrade management solutions uniquely offer centralized creation, validation, and storage of all trade documents—such as commercial invoices, packing lists, certificates of origin, and bills of lading—facilitating accuracy, audit readiness, and faster customs processing.\n\n**Major Highlights of the Trade Management Market**\n\nThe trade management market has seen significant expansion as global trade volumes increase and e-commerce continues to flourish. Businesses are investing in robust trade solutions to manage the complexities of international shipment flows, cross-border compliance, and multi-modal logistics more efficiently.\n\nA major highlight is the strong adoption of cloud-native trade management systems that offer scalability, real-time data access, and seamless integration with ERP, TMS, and customs systems. These platforms enable better collaboration, faster deployment, and lower IT overhead.\n\nWith constantly evolving trade regulations, companies are prioritizing advanced compliance automation, tariff management, and restricted party screening. This emphasis helps avoid fines, shipment delays, and reputational risk while maintaining smoother customs clearance.\n\nModern trade management solutions are incorporating analytics and AI-driven insights to provide predictive risk assessments, landed cost optimization, and performance benchmarking. These capabilities empower businesses to make strategic decisions that can reduce costs and improve operational efficiency.\n\n**Inquire Before Buying@**[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry\\_Before\\_BuyingNew.asp?id=70680100](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=70680100&utm_campaign=trademanagementmarket&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=referral)\n\n**Top Companies in the Trade Management Market**\n\nKey and innovative vendors in the trade management market are Oracle (US), Infor (US), Thomson Reuters (US), Livingston International (Canada), Aptean (US), SAP (Germany), Noatum Logistics (Spain), E2open (US), Descartes (Canada), CargoWise (Australia), Expeditors (US), BDP International (US), Accuity (US), QAD Precision (US), 3rdwave (Canada), AEB (Germany), Shipsy (India), Bamboo Rose (US), Bolero International (UK), MIC Customs Solutions (UK), OCR Services (US), Webb Fontaine (UAE), Neurored (Spain), 4PL Consultancy (UK), Global Custom Compliance (China), Vigilant Global Trade Services (US), and Centrade (US).\n\nOracle offers goods and services that cover all facets of business IT, including platforms, applications, and infrastructures.

The dollar is coming off its worst annual performance since 2017, with analysts predicting another year of decline.\n\n\"The U.S. economy still looks pretty good. A lot of the positioning in short U.S. dollar has already been done, and I think that's going to prevent the dollar from getting significantly weaker going forward,\" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis.\n\n\"I think the winners could be some emerging market currencies more than the euro or the yen,” he added.\n\nTraders are pricing in at least two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year, although a divided central bank indicated in December there would be only one cut in 2026. The Fed is expected to keep rates steady at its meeting this month.\n\nMarkets have kept geopolitical concerns in the background, focusing on economic data instead.\n\nHowever, risks that President Donald Trump's administration could be forced to refund more than to importers if the U.S. Supreme Court this week declares his duties unlawful could resurface to hurt the dollar.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday the 2027 U.S. military budget should be $1.5 trillion, stoking some concerns about rising debt and a [higher risk premium](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-dip-defense-firms-climb-up-trump-budget-plans-2026-01-08/) on U.S. assets.\n\n## EURO ZONE DATA AND GREENLAND IN FOCUS\n\nOn the euro front, recent inflation figures drove the currency lower and German Bund yields to a one-month low.\n\nThe euro was down 0.05% at $1.1669 on Thursday, after dropping by 0.45% in the last two sessions.\n\n“Soft European inflation reinforces dovish sentiment, while the Greenland crisis underscores Europe’s relative vulnerability, potentially triggering further euro selling,” said Olivier Korber, foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Trump retained the option to address his objective to take over [Greenland by military means](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-move-greenland-2026-01-07/), while alarmed allies, including France and Germany, were working on a response.\n\nAnalysts flagged that the debate about changes in the European Central Bank policy shifted towards the possibility of a rate hike a year from now, while inflation is currently getting back to target with core edging lower.\n\nThe Japanese yen was roughly unchanged at 156.70 per U.S. dollar.\n\n\"For those hoping for a significant appreciation of the yen, the only option for now is to wait for the conflict with China to cool down again,\" said Michael Pfister, foreign exchange strategist at Commerzbank.\n\n“The Chinese government could further escalate the conflict with a complete export ban on rare earths, which would deal a significant blow to the yen,” he added.\n\n[Shares in Japanese chemical manufacturers fell](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-chemical-makers-fall-after-china-anti-dumping-probe-announcement-2026-01-08/) on Thursday while those of their Chinese rivals jumped after China said it was launching an anti-dumping probe into imports of chemicals used in chipmaking.\n\nThe Australian dollar eased to $0.6704, just below the 15-month high it touched earlier this week.\n\nReporting by Stefano Rebaudo and Sophie Kiderlin;

The sharp increase in tariffs imposed last year by the Trump administration may reduce inflation rather than increase it, according to research published Monday by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, suggesting that interest-rate cuts may be the proper policy response.\n\nU.S. imports were subject to an average 17% levy last year, up from less than 3% at the end of 2024 and the highest rate since 1935, according to Yale Budget Lab.\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Ftariffs-may-lower-inflation-sf-fed-research-suggests-2026-01-05%2F)\n\n\"Our analysis of historical data highlights a possibility that the large tariff increase of 2025 could put upward pressure on unemployment while putting downward pressure on inflation,\" researchers Regis Barnichon and Aayush Singh said in the regional Fed bank's latest Economic Letter, which builds on their working paper published in November.\n\nThe finding draws on 150 years of empirical data on the United States as well as France and the UK.\n\nThe Fed held rates steady for much of last year on concern that tariffs would add to inflation, as theoretical models as well as some empirical data suggested.\n\nBy September, signs of labor market weakness and a growing conviction that any inflationary boost from tariffs would be short-lived prompted the Fed to begin a string of rate cuts that lowered short-term borrowing costs by a total of 75 basis points in 2025.\n\nThe historical findings may not apply perfectly to today's economy, the San Francisco Fed researchers wrote, noting that U.S. manufacturing today relies more on imported products than it did in the past, meaning that tariffs may now be more likely to trigger higher inflation.\n\nEconomic uncertainty and a drop in stock prices, both of which typically coincide with large tariff shocks, may explain why higher import levies reduced inflation in the past, the researchers found.\n\nThey did not examine how that historical experience may have mapped to last year, when uncertainty by many measures rose sharply but major U.S. stock indexes also posted double-digit gains, fueling U.S. household spending and buoying the economy.\n\nReporting by Ann Saphir, Editing by William Maclean\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n## Read Next\n\n* [India's central bank to manage capital city's banking business, debt](/world/india/indias-central-bank-manage-capital-citys-banking-business-debt-2026-01-05/)\n* [Businesscategory](/business/)\n\n  [Apollo-led investors boost QXO's war chest as building-product deals heat up](/business/apollo-led-investors-commit-12-billion-building-products-firm-qxo-2026-01-05/)\n* [Morning Bid: Geopolitics take center stage in the new year](/world/china/global-markets-view-usa-2026-01-05/)\n* [Sustainabilitycategory](/sustainability/)\n\n  [China nudges banks to disclose lending ties with Venezuela, Bloomberg News reports](/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/china-nudges-banks-disclose-lending-ties-with-venezuela-bloomberg-news-reports-2026-01-05/)\n* [United Kingdomcategory](/world/uk/)\n\n  [UK consumer borrowing rises by most since November 2023](/world/uk/uk-mortgage-approvals-dip-november-consumer-borrowing-rises-2026-01-05/)\n\n## [Business](/business/)\n\n* ### [Italy closes probe into DeepSeek after commitments to warn of AI 'hallucination' risks](/world/china/italy-closes-probe-into-deepseek-after-commitments-warn-ai-hallucination-risks-2026-01-05/)\n\n  [category](/world/) · · ago\n\n  Italy’s antitrust authority has ended an investigation into the Chinese AI system DeepSeek for allegedly failing to warn users that it may produce false information, agreeing to binding commitments as a condition for closing the case.\n* [Sustainabilitycategory](/sustainability/)[Amazon must face price gouging lawsuit, US judge rules](/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/amazon-must-face-price-gouging-lawsuit-us-judge-rules-2026-01-05/)\n* [Businesscategory](/business/)[Canadian dollar lags G10 currencies on Venezuela uncertainty](/business/canadian-dollar-lags-g10-currencies-venezuela-uncertainty-2026-01-05/)\n* [Financecategory](/business/finance/)[Digital bank PicPay files for US IPO](/business/finance/digital-bank-picpay-files-us-ipo-2026-01-05/)\n* [category](/world/)[Dollar retreats with markets focused on US data, shrugging off Venezuela](/world/americas/dollar-firmer-venezuela-raid-hangs-over-sentiment-2026-01-05/)",

Any resemblances to actual future events are purely coincidental. This scenario is plausible, but certainly not inevitable. It is offered in the modest hope that it will inspire and inform efforts to prevent the disastrous outcome described here.\n\nIt is January 2028. Looking back, the Americans did not “take” Greenland—not in any concrete sense. There was no invasion, no purchase, not even a plebiscite. But in the shadowy corridors of Arctic politics, Washington moved deliberately to confound its opponents. The Americanization of Greenland transcended brute imperial force in the Russian mold.\n\nTwo years earlier, in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s showy military ouster of Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro—and Trump’s insistence that he intended to take over Greenland next—foreign policy analysts had been scrambling to imagine how he might seize the island. Would he force Denmark to sell its semiautonomous territory? Send in the troops, effectively attacking a NATO ally? But Trump didn’t have to do either. Instead, his administration pioneered a new form of twenty-first-century imperialism in which sovereignty over territory is imposed less by force than by function, through investments, contractors, and legal ambiguities. In the process, Trump’s Greenland gambit rewrote the rules of international order and created a template that Beijing, Moscow, and others soon followed. Now known as “geo-osmosis,” what follows is the story of how it happened.\n\n### **FROM TROLLING TO TRUTH**\n\nTrump originally floated the idea of acquiring Greenland in his first term. The 2019 revelation that he had inquired about purchasing the territory from Denmark was met with global bemusement and a curt “Greenland is not for sale” response from the Danish and Greenlandic governments. Few in Brussels, Copenhagen, or Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, took the threat seriously. After all, Trump had long trafficked in hyperbolic bombast.\n\nSeasoned Trump observers noted, however, that the idea of territorial acquisition had long held a special place in Trump’s worldview. Greenland grabbed Trump’s attention as “essentially, a big real estate deal,” as he put it, an accomplishment that the journalists Peter Baker and Susan Glasser note in a 2022 book “might give him a place in American history like William Seward’s purchase of Alaska from Russia.”\n\nEarly in his second term, Trump revived the proposal and gave it a geopolitical rationale. His argument that the United States should control Greenland had three pillars: It would help the country secure critical resources—the island is estimated to have enormous oil and gas reserves as well as troves of rare-earth minerals such as cobalt, graphite, and lithium. It would expand the U.S. military’s reach in the Arctic. And it would limit Chinese and Russian influence in a territory key to U.S. national security.\n\nBut when Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen offered to give the U.S. president more or less anything he wanted short of sovereignty to achieve those goals, Trump simply refused. It became clear that he was not actually interested in Arctic security. Rather, Greenland became the first in a series of Trumpian territorial ambitions that included Canada, the Panama Canal, and even the Gaza Strip—acquisitions that he apparently believed might secure his place on Mount Rushmore.\n\nAs was so often the case with Trump, it was difficult to separate the trolling from the truth. But it soon emerged that Greenland was a genuine target. With a more loyal second-term team ready to carry out his whims and a supine Congress, his administration was able to create a plan to make his desire a reality.\n\n### **ABSORB AND CONQUER**\n\nIn Greenland, the Trump administration lifted a few elements from its Venezuela template: for instance, the administration directed U.S. spy agencies to step up efforts to identify people in Greenland and Denmark who could support their objectives for the island, just as it leaned on the CIA to help overthrow Maduro. But Trump’s apparatchiks quickly concluded that the best way to control Greenland was not to follow the Venezuela model or to buy Greenland. Regardless of its immediate success, overt military action against a NATO ally would only ignite local and global opposition and limit the United States’ ability to assert sovereignty over the island. But they could control it by cleverly exploiting its supply dependencies.\n\nThe administration understood that Greenland was economically and politically fragile. At 56,000 people, its population was 500 times smaller than Venezuela’s. Manhattan’s East Village had more residents. A mostly uninhabitable ice sheet a quarter of the size of the U.S. mainland, its people were scattered and its infrastructure spotty; with only 93 miles of roads, many Greenlandic communities could reach the others only by boat, small plane, snowmobile, or dogsled, and less than 70 percent of the population used the Internet. Greenlanders had long resented Danish rule and accused the Danish government of keeping them poor and dependent. The island’s semiautonomous government, limited budgetary sovereignty, and simmering independence movement—most Greenlandic political parties ostensibly wanted the territory to gain full autonomy—made it highly susceptible to external influence. Add to this a thin institutional infrastructure and a lack of indigenous wealth, and you had an ideal laboratory for what Trump officials at the time termed “motivated alignment.”\n\nA planning cell in the White House began drafting what was euphemistically titled the Northern Strategic Realignment Initiative. With information from U.S. spy agencies in hand, in May 2026, the Trump administration announced a $10 billion “strategic development initiative” for Greenland, ostensibly to upgrade infrastructure and promote the exploitation of the island’s natural resources.\n\n> The Americans did not need the Greenlandic population’s consent.\n\nWashington moved through proxies. A patchwork of development consortiums, disaster response teams, nongovernmental organizations, consultants, and Arctic energy forums, almost all boasting loose ties to Trump-aligned donors or U.S. government funding, descended on Greenland in the summer of 2026. The activities of these polite people were ostensibly civilian: installing broadband, training local officials, or building roads, small airports, and health centers. Investment was deployed not nationally but municipally. Coastal communities received critical supplies, construction contracts, and digital infrastructure grants. The money came with no overt political strings, but it did have an accompanying series of technical agreements and memorandums that quietly shifted local loyalties and forced budgetary dependence.\n\nThis flurry of help and investment did not fool most Greenlanders. As early as January 2025, a survey jointly commissioned by Danish and Greenlandic newspapers showed that over 85 percent of the island’s residents opposed Greenland’s incorporation into the United States, and those numbers never changed very much. Greenlanders feared the erosion of their culture and autonomy, not to mention having to navigate the nightmare of the U.S. health-care system. But some of Greenland’s government officials and community leaders, long frustrated by Copenhagen’s paternalism and budget constraints, found themselves tempted by these American offers.\n\nThus, the U.S. efforts set the terms of Greenland’s next political phase. The Americans funded local media. They offered fellowships to emerging political leaders. Washington pushed a framing of Greenlandic identity in opposition to Danish “colonialism”—and as compatible with U.S. patronage. Ultimately, the Americans did not need the population’s consent. They just needed a few collaborators amid a general sense of fatigue and cynicism with politics as usual—an attitude Trump’s team is skilled at seeding.\n\n### **FEALTY FOLLOWS FUNCTION**\n\nThe sovereignty campaign was therefore not one of persuasion. It was one of circumvention and absorption. Trump’s advisers understood that Greenland’s democratic mechanisms could be rerouted by fragmenting the elite, creating greater economic dependence, and generating a need for emergency governance. Danish resupply routes began to face delays as ships were stopped and searched at sea. Fuel shortages, medical supply bottlenecks, and bureaucratic “miscommunications” caused by unexplained electricity and Internet outages pushed municipalities toward the only actors offering an alternative: the Americans.\n\nAround 150 U.S. service members had already been stationed at Pituffik Space Base in northern Greenland. But acting on humanitarian grounds, the U.S. military rapidly expanded its footprint. Emergency logistics hubs became new de facto bases. U.S. contractors took over local security training. By October, several Greenlandic lawmakers had formed a “Sovereign Future Caucus,” signaling their openness to “alternative security and economic partnerships.” One Trump adviser described it as “the Taiwan model in reverse: build deep ties first and let the sovereignty claims follow.”\n\nBy early 2027, Greenland was operating in a sovereignty twilight. Formally, it was still part of the Danish realm, but it had become functionally dependent on a U.S. presidential administration that had not even bothered to try to secure Greenlandic popular support.\n\n> Greenland’s democratic mechanisms could be rerouted.\n\nTo move from de facto integration toward de jure sovereignty, the U.S. Justice Department assembled a legal framework that invoked historical precedent. Drawing on the 1917 U.S. purchase of the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands), and citing Greenland’s right to self-determination under the UN Charter, Trump administration lawyers constructed what they called a sovereignty transition plan.\n\nThe Trump team avoided a national referendum, knowing it would fail. Instead, the administration encouraged the Greenlandic parliament to adopt a declaration of “provisional autonomy” and offered Washington’s recognition of Greenlandic sovereignty in principle. It was a phrase loaded with possibilities and devoid of obligations. A letter of support from pro-American Greenlandic officials, signed in July 2027, set the plan in motion. The U.S. then formally beganstationing U.S. security forces in Nuuk, using the letter to claim that they had been invited by the Greenlandic parliament, even though no vote had been held.\n\nIn October 2027, Greenland’s parliament declared provisional autonomy and an “interim sovereignty transition.” The United States raised its flag over new “civil-military liaison offices” in Nuuk and Greenland’s three next-largest towns. Negotiations to grant Greenland a compact of free association, akin to those the United States has with Micronesia or the Marshall Islands, began immediately afterward.\n\n### **EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN**\n\nThese efforts, of course, ignited a firestorm in Denmark. The Danish government declared the sovereignty transition plan a “hostile act” and withdrew its ambassador from Washington. The European Union denounced it as a violation of international law. The French president called it “a colonial anachronism wrapped in nationalist theatrics.” But Denmark had little military or economic leverage to wield. And the EU, more focused on managing other elements of its strained relationship with the United States, was unwilling to do anything beyond “monitoring the situation.”\n\nMeanwhile, Russian bombers conducted patrols near Greenlandic airspace. Chinese state media outlets declared the United States a “rogue imperialist actor,” even as many of their diplomats took notes. But these efforts only strengthened Trump’s case that the United States needed to control Greenland to protect it—and shore up U.S. national security.\n\nThe Greenland gambit divided American public opinion: MAGA conservatives hailed Trump’s move as a “strategic masterstroke,” while critics likened it to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and warned that the United States’ global credibility had suffered irreparably. But the administration’s media machine lurched into action, launching a public relations campaign called “America’s Frozen Frontier,” and Fox News aired segments with AI-generated images of Greenlandic children waving U.S. flags. Maps were redrawn. Trump rallies in Michigan and Pennsylvania featured chants of “Make Greenland Great Again.” The Trump Organization announced plans to make the island the “biggest, most beautiful winter resort” in human history, with fjord-based heli-skiing and extensive glamping opportunities.\n\nDenmark challenged the United States’ moves at the International Court of Justice, but the case languished in procedural purgatory, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed it as “nonsense.” Indigenous Greenlandic voices remained split: although some elites embraced U.S. investments, most residents warned of coming environmental degradation and cultural erasure. None of that mattered. U.S. contractors continued to deliver services. Washington concluded its association compact with Nuuk, assumed full authority over Greenland’s defense and security affairs, and asserted a claim that Greenland represented a U.S. “special economic zone.” Trump declared victory.\n\n### **THE COLD BENEATH THE ICE**\n\nDecades later, the Greenland gambit would be studied as the prototype for a new form of state expansion, one that blurs the lines between consent, coercion, and capitulation. The Trump administration showed that territory need not be seized when it can be absorbed. It affirmed a simple truth of twenty-first-century geopolitics: in the absence of coherent international resistance, norms matter little; facts on the ground suffice. Commentators drew a direct line from the Trump team’s effort in Greenland to the later Russian absorption of Georgia and, of course, the Chinese takeover of Taiwan.\n\nIt also redefined the nature of international order and sovereignty. Manufactured dependence was no longer considered a form of imperialism; they became a method for building fraternal ties. Indigenous populations no longer determined sovereignty; supply chains did.

She added that his team is weighing a range of options — including the possibility of using military force.\n\nChinese authorities have [pushed back](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202601/t20260105_11806736.html). On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized Washington for \"using the so-called 'China threat' as a pretext for itself to seek selfish gains.\"\n\n## Frozen frontiers\n\nChina described itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in its [2018 official Arctic Policy](https://english.www.gov.cn/archive/white_paper/2018/01/26/content_281476026660336.htm), asserting its right to use resources and develop shipping routes in the Arctic.\n\nState-linked Chinese firms have also invested heavily in Arctic energy projects and developed maritime routes that could reduce shipping times between Asia and Europe.\n\n\"China would push back hard against any U.S. move to take control of Greenland, given Beijing's commercial interests on the island — from resource exploration to the security of Arctic shipping routes,\" said Xinbo Wu, director at the Center for American Studies at Shanghai-based Fudan University.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department [has identified China and Russia as key competitors](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3855787/now-the-hard-part-implementing-arctic-strategy/) in the region, pointing to their expanded military capabilities and joint naval patrols as risks to national security.\n\nBeijing could seek to raise costs for Washington through multilateral diplomacy and may deepen military cooperation with Russia in the Arctic region to deter the U.S., Wu said.\n\n\"We are really getting into uncharted territory and we have to be extremely careful,\" said Henry Wang, founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization, a think-tank that often aligns with Beijing's thinking.\n\n\"The international community has to work together now and probably stop this kind of unilateral approach.\"\n\n## Energy, rare earths, infrastructure\n\nBeijing's main interests in Greenland mirror those of the U.S.: [rare earths](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/greenland-rare-earths-us-china-processing-reality-mining-arctic-shipping-lanes-route-critical-minerals.html), uranium and zinc, said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group.\n\nGreenland, a vast and sparsely populated autonomous Danish territory, hosts several large rare-earth element deposits, with some discovered mines ranking [among the world's largest](https://eng.geus.dk/media/13174/go29.pdf). These minerals are crucial for high-tech industries, from electric vehicles to defense equipment.\n\nBesides the U.S. and China, the [European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6166) has also tried to secure access to these critical mineral supplies.\n\nChinese investors have grown \"much more cautious\" about Greenland in recent years amid rising geopolitical uncertainty, said Patrik Andersson, an analyst at the Swedish National China Center at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs.\n\nDenmark retains the legal authority to block foreign investments on national security grounds.\n\nIn 2016, a Hong Kong-linked firm attempted to acquire a former Danish naval base and related port facilities, prompting Copenhagen to block the sale. A Chinese state-owned firm also withdrew its bid for an airport construction contract worth 3.6 billion Danish kroner ($563 million) in 2019 after Greenland chose Denmark over Beijing to finance the project.\n\nAndersson noted that in some cases, Chinese interest in Greenland's minerals appeared to have already declined before the recent rise in geopolitical risk, in part due to the high costs of operating in Greenland.\n\n\"From a commercial standpoint, Chinese investors may see more attractive opportunities elsewhere,\" he added.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO6:3606:36\n\nTrump's Greenland ambitions are a wake up call: Chinese think tank\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nSome Chinese-backed projects in Greenland have also stalled over environmental concerns.\n\nChinese state-affiliated company [Shenghe Resources](/quotes/392-SZ/) acquired a stake in [the Kvanefjeld project in south](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2020/presence-before-power/4-greenland-what-is-china-doing-there-and-why/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20Kvanefjeld,Kvanefjeld%20site.%EF%BB%BF%5B75%5D)[ern Greenland in 2016](https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20161031/pdf/43ch5gzhvhrmhq.pdf). The project, which was set to become one of the world's largest rare-earth and uranium mines, was halted after Greenland [reinstated a ban](https://archive.is/3cbEl) on uranium mining in 2021.\n\nWhile some analysts have estimated Chinese investments in the Arctic at over $90 billion and described them as \"unconstrained,\" Harvard University's Kennedy School said the figures are \"highly exaggerated\" because they included failed investments and unbuilt projects.\n\nAccording to [Harvard's estimates](https://www.belfercenter.org/research-analysis/china-arctic-investments) in June 2025, most of the mineral, oil and gas resource projects in Greenland with Chinese backing had been paused or canceled.\n\nDespite those setbacks, Greenland [opened its representation office in Beijing in 2023](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-10-28/VHJhbnNjcmlwdDc1NTc3/index.html) as the Arctic country sought to deepen ties with Beijing.\n\n## 'Polar Silk Road'\n\nChina has eyes on new shipping routes opening up as melting ice opens shorter paths between Asia and Europe. China's exports to the European Union, its second-largest trading bloc, [grew 8.1% year-on-year](http://www.customs.gov.cn/customs/2025-12/08/article_2025122717403341061.html) in the first eleven months of 2025.\n\nBeijing formally introduced the \"Polar Silk Road\" in its 2018 Arctic policy white paper and launched its [first Arctic shipping route to Europe](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202509/1344211.shtml) in September 2025, cutting transit times to about 20 days, roughly half the time needed for a journey through [the Suez Canal](https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/p/0P9505FV.html).\n\nThe alternative sea route presents not only \"immense economic opportunities\" for Beijing through faster trade and access to untapped natural resources, but also a \"strategic challenge to the United States' dominance of global sea lanes,\" said Zoha Fatima, a researcher focused on Arctic governance and geopolitics.\n\nChina has also expanded Arctic research efforts over the years, supporting discoveries related to sea ice composition, space weather and marine life.\n\nBuilding on existing projects in Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland, China has also [planned a research](https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/online-analysis/2020/02/china-arctic/) and satellite ground station in Greenland.\n\nThese facilities are crucial for China's Beidou navigation satellite system, developed as an alternative to the U.S.'s GPS system.\n\nChina's polar research programs have raised security concerns in the Arctic. In 2022, the Biden administration [asserted that](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/National-Strategy-for-the-Arctic-Region.pdf) China used its scientific engagements to conduct \"dual-use research with intelligence or military applications.\"\n\n\"If Trump were to take Greenland, Beijing would frame this as U.S. unilateralism and North Atlantic militarization, while stressing respect for Danish-Greenlandic autonomy and UN-based rules,\" said Eurasia's Wang.\n\n*— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng, Emily Tan contributed to this story.*",

But the crisis has exposed an uncomfortable reality - Denmark is [rallying support](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-move-greenland-2026-01-07/) to protect a territory whose population wants independence, and whose largest opposition party now wants to bypass Copenhagen and [negotiate directly with Washington](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-should-hold-talks-with-us-without-denmark-opposition-leader-says-2026-01-08/).\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fdenmarks-greenland-dilemma-defending-territory-already-its-way-out-2026-01-10%2F)\n\n\"Denmark risks exhausting its foreign policy capital to secure Greenland, only to watch it walk away afterwards,\" said Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen, a political science professor at University of Copenhagen.\n\n## STRATEGIC RELEVANCE\n\nDenmark cannot let Greenland go without losing its [geopolitical relevance](https://www.reuters.com/world/why-does-trump-want-greenland-could-he-get-it-2025-01-08/) in the [Arctic territory](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GREENLAND-ELECTION/MAPS/zjvqaeledvx/), strategically located between Europe and North America and a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system.\n\nYet it may ultimately have nothing to show for its efforts if [Greenlanders choose independence](https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland/) - or strike their own deal with Washington.\n\nThe stakes extend beyond Denmark's national interests. European allies have rallied behind Denmark not just out of solidarity, but because giving up Greenland would set a dangerous precedent that could embolden other powers to pursue territorial claims against smaller nations, upending the post-1945 world order.\n\nDenmark's foreign ministry declined to comment, but referred to joint remarks by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on December 22.\n\n\"National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,\" the two leaders said. \"They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country ... Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.\"\n\nThis week, Frederiksen said: \"If the U.S. chooses to attack another NATO country, everything stops, including NATO and the security the alliance has provided since World War Two.\"\n\n## THE 'GREENLAND CARD'\n\nFor now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table, including buying the territory or taking it by force.\n\nCopenhagen professor Rasmussen said any discussion of whether holding on to Greenland is worth the cost has been drowned out by outrage at Trump's threats.\n\n\"It is not part of the political debate in Denmark. I fear we have gone into patriotic overdrive,\" he said.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Greenland's strategic location gave Denmark outsized influence in Washington and allowed it to maintain lower defence spending than would otherwise be expected of a NATO ally.\n\nThis became known as \"the Greenland Card\", according to a 2017 report by the University of Copenhagen's Centre for Military Studies.\n\nBut Greenland's aspirations for self-determination have been brewing since the former colony got greater autonomy and its own parliament in 1979. A 2009 agreement explicitly recognised Greenlanders' right to independence if they choose.\n\nAll Greenlandic parties say they want independence, but differ on how, and when, to achieve it.\n\nTrump's pressure has accelerated a timeline that was already in motion, forcing Copenhagen to spend political capital and financial resources on a relationship with an increasingly uncertain endpoint.\n\n\"How much should we fight for someone who doesn't really care about us?\" Joachim B. Olsen, a political commentator and former Danish lawmaker, told Reuters.\n\n## THE FINANCIAL BURDEN\n\nCopenhagen provides an annual block grant of roughly 4.3 billion Danish crowns ($610 million) to Greenland's economy, which is near stagnation with GDP growth of just 0.2% in 2025.\n\nThe central bank estimates an annual financing gap of approximately 800 million Danish crowns to make current public finances sustainable. Denmark also covers police, the justice system and defence - bringing total annual spending to just under $1 billion.\n\nIn addition, Copenhagen last year announced a 42 billion Danish crowns ($6.54 billion) [Arctic defence package](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/denmark-boost-arctic-defence-by-426-billion-greenland-government-says-2025-10-10/) in response to U.S. criticism that Denmark has not done enough to protect Greenland.\n\nSome reject framing the relationship in [transactional terms](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/can-us-put-price-tag-greenland-2026-01-09/), pointing to Denmark's legal and moral obligations under international law and centuries of shared history.\n\n\"We're talking about family relations, long history of relations between Denmark and Greenland,\" said Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. \"So this is much more, it's not just about defence and economy, it's about feelings, it's about culture.\"\n\n## DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT\n\nPrime Minister Frederiksen faces a difficult balancing act, said Serafima Andreeva, researcher at Oslo-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute.\n\nFor now, Denmark has little choice but to stand firm to maintain its diplomatic credibility, but in doing so risks the relationship with the United States at a time \"when Russia is an accelerating threat and being on the U.S.'s bad side is no good for anyone in the West\".\n\nFrederiksen also faces an election this year, though Greenland has not been a major theme.\n\n\"I don't understand why we have to cling to this community with Greenland when they so badly want out of it,\" Lone Frank, a Danish science writer and broadcaster, told Reuters. \"To be completely honest, Greenland doesn't inspire any sense of belonging in me.\"\n\nReporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen; additional reporting by Soren Sirich Jeppesen and Tom Little; Editing by Alex Richardson\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen](/authors/jacob-gronholt-pedersen/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nBased in Copenhagen, Jacob oversees reporting from Denmark, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

As for other global powers, while [Russia is conspicuously quiet](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/russia-moscow-reaction-trump-greenland-takeover-ambitions.html) — probably because it is more interested in seeing any division in NATO over this affair — [China is keenly watching developments](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/us-trump-china-greenland-denmark-arctic-tensions-trump-rare-earth-elements-minerals-mining.html), having described itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in 2018. Any transaction — or operation — on this scale will have global repercussions.\n\n## What you need to know today\n\n**U.S. considering investing in mining projects in Greenland.** Amaroq, which operates on the island, said the White House is talking to it about [investment in its projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/-greenland-critical-minerals-mining-amaroq-us-government.html) that extract or explore gold, gallium and other critical mineral deposits.\n\n**Trump administration races to come up with Greenland takeover plan.** U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubiois set to [meet Denmark officials](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/greenland-rubio-denmark-trump.html) next week to discuss the situation. Here are [four key issues surrounding](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/greenland-trump-takeover-bid-denmark-what-happens-next.html) the meeting.\n\n**Chinese inflation accelerates in December.** The country's [consumer price index rose 0.8%](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/china-december-inflation-cpi-ppi-prices-demand-weakness.html) from a year earlier, as expected by a Reuters poll of economists. That's the highest level since Feb. 2023. However, inflation was flat for 2025 as a whole.\n\n**Divergence between U.S. indexes.** The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/quotes/.DJI/) roseThursday but the [Nasdaq Composite](/quotes/.IXIC/) slid as [investors rotated out of tech](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html). [Asia-Pacific markets mostly advanced](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/asia-pacific-markets-china-cpi-hang-seng-index-kospi-nikkei-225.html) Friday. Australia's [Rio Tinto](/quotes/RIO-AU/) had its worst day since 2022 on news it had entered buyout talks with [Glencore](/quotes/GLEN-GB/). Meanwhile, Asian defense stocks broadly climbed.\n\n**[PRO] Venezuela bond bets pay off.** Lee Robinson, founder and chief investment officer of distressed debt investor Altana Wealth, captured returns of 30% in Venezuelan bonds after the U.S. attack on the country. Robinson said there's [\"more upside\" to come.](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/venezuela-maduro-oil-trump-overthrow-russia-china-hedge-fund.html)\n\n## And finally...\n\n[**Trump is desperate to take Greenland. Can NATO defend itself — and is it willing to?**](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/nato-trump-greenland-war-invade-defense.html)\n\nEurope spent much of 2025 scrambling to bolster its defenses against Russia — but just a week into the new year, it's being forced to rethink security once again amid U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to annex Greenland.\n\nOn Monday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned an American takeover of Greenland would spell the end of NATO. Of NATO's 32 members, 23 – including Denmark – are also members of the European Union, which has been working extensively to ensure Trump's administration continues its [support for Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/12/ukraine-war-trump-frustrated-amid-warning-putin-can-escalate-conflict.html).\n\n*— Chloe Taylor*\n\nGet the CNBC Daily Open report in your inbox every morning and keep up to date with the markets wherever you are.\n\n[APAC Edition](https://www.cnbc.com/newsletter/daily-open-apac/) [EMEA Edition](https://www.cnbc.com/newsletter/daily-open-emea/)\n\n## [More In Daily Open](https://www.cnbc.com/daily-open/)\n\n[CNBC Daily Open: U.S. moves over Greenland are heating up quickly](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/cnbc-daily-open-us-moves-over-greenland-are-heating-up-quickly.html)\n\n[Yeo Boon Ping](https://www.cnbc.com/yeo-boon-ping/)\n\n[CNBC Daily Open: Magnificent Seven competition heats up](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/cnbc-daily-open-magnificent-seven-competition-heats-up.html)\n\n[Yeo Boon Ping](https://www.cnbc.com/yeo-boon-ping/)\n\n[CNBC Daily Open: Rumbles within the Magnificent Seven](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/cnbc-daily-open-rumbles-within-the-magnificent-seven.html)\n\n[Yeo Boon Ping](https://www.cnbc.com/yeo-boon-ping/)\n\n[Read More](https://www.cnbc.com/daily-open/ \"Read More\")",

Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nThere have been some legislative efforts in Congress to pursue such a proposal but they are yet to become law and in his post Trump did not offer explicit support to any specific bill.\n\nOpposition lawmakers have criticized Trump, a Republican, for failing to deliver on his campaign pledge.\n\n\"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, without providing more details.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies,\" Trump added.\n\nU.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat in the Senate Banking Committee, said Trump's call was meaningless without a bill being passed by Congress.\n\n\"Begging credit card companies to play nice is a joke. I said a year ago if Trump was serious, I'd work to pass a bill to cap rates,\" Warren said, while criticizing Trump's attempts to gut the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on details of the call from Trump, but said on social media without elaborating that the president was capping the rates.\n\nSome major U.S. banks and credit card issuers like [American Express](/quotes/AXP/), [Capital One Financial](/quotes/COF/), [JPMorgan Chase](/quotes/JPM/), [Citigroup](/quotes/C/) and [Bank of America](/quotes/BAC/) did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome banking advocacy groups said in a joint statement that a 10% interest rate cap would \"reduce credit availability\" and \"only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.\"\n\nThe statement came from the Consumer Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum and Independent Community Bankers of America.\n\n## Lawmakers have raised concerns about rates\n\nIndependent U.S. Sen [Bernie Sanders](https://www.cnbc.com/bernie-sanders/) of Vermont, a fierce Trump critic, and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a Republican, have previously introduced bipartisan legislation to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for five years. This bill explicitly directs credit card companies to limit rates as part of broader consumer relief legislation.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida have also introduced a bill in the House to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, reflecting cross-aisle interest in addressing high rates.\n\nBillionaire fund manager [Bill Ackman](https://www.cnbc.com/bill-ackman/), who endorsed Trump in the last elections, said on X the U.S. president's call was a \"mistake.\"\n\nLast year, the Trump administration moved to scrap a credit card late fee rule from the era of former President [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/).\n\nThe Trump administration had asked a federal court to throw out a regulation capping credit card late fees at $8, saying it agreed with business and banking groups that alleged the rule was illegal. A federal judge subsequently threw out the rule.",

They rely on the extra interest income to offset losses when some cardholders default, making it harder to lend profitably to riskier customers.\n\n\"We estimate it would swing the business to unprofitable if enacted, with subprime credit cards hardest hit,\" Truist Securities wrote in a note.\n\nIn a joint statement, banking industry bodies said the move will hurt \"millions of American families and small business owners.\"\n\n## HOW WILL BANKS AND CONSUMER LENDERS BE IMPACTED?\n\nFor banks and consumer lenders, an interest-rate cap would cut into one of their most profitable lending businesses. Credit card interest rates can climb as high as 30%, compared with an average rate just above 6% on a 30-year fixed mortgage, according to Bankrate.\n\nA rate cap could wipe out billions of dollars in interest income for banks and card issuers, analysts say, forcing lenders to rethink the scale and pricing of their card businesses.\n\n\"If this were to be enacted, there will be material headwinds to card profitability and likely result in card issuers tightening credit boxes meaningfully, particularly to high-risk borrowers,\" analysts at Barclays said.\n\n## WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM A CAP ON CREDIT CARD INTEREST RATES?\n\nA tightening of credit in a heavily regulated banking sector could push some consumers, particularly subprime borrowers, toward buy-now, pay-later providers, pawn shops and even loan sharks.\n\n\"This rate cap would not address the root of the problem and could push consumers towards more expensive debt if the cap does not apply to other unsecured consumer products,\" J.P. Morgan analysts said.\n\n\"It could push more borrowing away from banks into other unsecured loans such as pawn shops and other non-bank consumer lenders.\"\n\nBorrowing from the less regulated parts of the credit market would increase risks for consumers already under financial strain.\n\nBuy-now, pay-later services, which typically earn money from merchants rather than charging interest to consumers, have surged in popularity in recent years, particularly among younger borrowers, and could benefit if banks rein in credit card lending.\n\nReporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Manya Saini](/authors/manya-saini/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nManya reports on prominent publicly listed U.S. financial firms, including Wall Street’s biggest banks, card companies, asset managers, and fintechs.

Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nThere have been some legislative efforts in Congress to pursue such a proposal but they are yet to become law and in his post Trump did not offer explicit support to any specific bill.\n\nOpposition lawmakers have criticized Trump, a Republican, for not having delivered on his campaign pledge.\n\n\"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, without providing more details.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies,\" Trump added.\n\nU.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat in the Senate Banking Committee, said Trump's call was meaningless without a bill being passed by Congress.\n\n\"Begging credit card companies to play nice is a joke.

So it shouldn’t do much for oil prices although it does indicate the beginnings of a constructive dialogue on oil.” It may benefit U.S. refiners “who will receive more of the heavy crude they are set up for,” he adds. WTI is down 1.1% at $56.49 a barrel, and Brent if off 0.6% at $60.32.(anthony.harrup@wsj.com) [...] 1149 GMT – Oil prices recoup some losses but continue to trade lower, with focus on geopolitical developments in Venezuela and Ukraine. President Trump said Venezuela would turn over as much as 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the U.S. as he pushes for more control of the country’s oil sector. Meanwhile, the U.K. and France said they will set up military hubs across Ukraine if a cease-fire agreement with Russia is reached, offering some of the clearest details so far of the security guarantees Western allies will offer Kyiv. However, “while this is seen as a crucial step towards a peace agreement by Ukraine, it might turn out to be a no-go for Russia,” analysts at DNB say. Brent crude slips 0.3% to $60.51 a barrel, while WTI is down 0.6% to $56.81 a barrel.

So it shouldn’t do much for oil prices although it does indicate the beginnings of a constructive dialogue on oil.” It may benefit U.S. refiners “who will receive more of the heavy crude they are set up for,” he adds. WTI is down 1.1% at $56.49 a barrel, and Brent if off 0.6% at $60.32.([anthony.harrup@wsj.com](mailto:anthony.harrup@wsj.com))\n\n### Oil Slips as Traders Weigh Venezuela, Ukraine Developments\n\n1149 GMT – Oil prices recoup some losses but continue to trade lower, with focus on geopolitical developments in Venezuela and Ukraine. President Trump said Venezuela would turn over as much as 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the U.S. as he pushes for more control of the country’s oil sector. Meanwhile, the U.K. and France said they will set up military hubs across Ukraine if a cease-fire agreement with Russia is reached, offering some of the clearest details so far of the security guarantees Western allies will offer Kyiv. However, “while this is seen as a crucial step towards a peace agreement by Ukraine, it might turn out to be a no-go for Russia,” analysts at DNB say. Brent crude slips 0.3% to $60.51 a barrel, while WTI is down 0.6% to $56.81 a barrel. ([giulia.petroni@wsj.com](mailto:giulia.petroni@wsj.com))\n\nCopyright ©2026 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

If the U.S. were to lift sanctions on Venezuelan oil it could release barrels “and only add to the surplus that the market is already experiencing,” says Mizuho’s Robert Yawger. A substantial increase in Venezuelan production is widely expected to be a long-term prospect, although from around 1 million barrels a day at present “Venezuela could get to 1.5 million rather quickly,” Yawger says. “And I think Gulf coast refiners would be happy to take those barrels.” WTI settles down 2% at $57.13 a barrel, compared with $57.32 Friday. Brent falls 1.7% to $60.70 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com) [...] ### Crude Futures Ease Back From Early Gains\n\n1057 ET – Oil futures relinquish early gains with the market still weighing the implications of developments in Venezuela, while concerns about oversupply in 2026 remain. The ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro may have briefly camouflaged those concerns, but “I suspect the veil is going to be lifted again,” says Societe Generale’s Ben Hoff. “We’re going to have to face the hard reality that we are looking at a wall of crude heading onshore, something I think has been on people’s minds,” he adds. Crude’s move higher in the wake of the U.S. operation to remove Maduro was “more short-term market sentiment than anything fundamental,” he says.

If the U.S. were to lift sanctions on Venezuelan oil it could release barrels “and only add to the surplus that the market is already experiencing,” says Mizuho’s Robert Yawger. A substantial increase in Venezuelan production is widely expected to be a long-term prospect, although from around 1 million barrels a day at present “Venezuela could get to 1.5 million rather quickly,” Yawger says. “And I think Gulf coast refiners would be happy to take those barrels.” WTI settles down 2% at $57.13 a barrel, compared with $57.32 Friday. Brent falls 1.7% to $60.70 a barrel. ([anthony.harrup@wsj.com](mailto:anthony.harrup@wsj.com))\n\n### Crude Futures Ease Back From Early Gains\n\n1057 ET – Oil futures relinquish early gains with the market still weighing the implications of developments in Venezuela, while concerns about oversupply in 2026 remain. The ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro may have briefly camouflaged those concerns, but “I suspect the veil is going to be lifted again,” says Societe Generale’s Ben Hoff. “We’re going to have to face the hard reality that we are looking at a wall of crude heading onshore, something I think has been on people’s minds,” he adds. Crude’s move higher in the wake of the U.S. operation to remove Maduro was “more short-term market sentiment than anything fundamental,” he says. WTI is off 0.1% at $58.26 a barrel and Brent is near flat at $61.75.([anthony.harrup@wsj.com](mailto:anthony.harrup@wsj.com))\n\nCopyright ©2026 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The country’s energy infrastructure is in a dire state and tens of billions of investment will be needed to get things back up and running, Michael Brown of Pepperstone says in a note. “In any case, the extra-heavy sour nature of Venezuelan crude means the economics of extraction don’t really add up with Brent at $60 a barrel.” Any potential output increase “is a story for a much later date,” he says, and “nothing we’ve seen so far materially shifts the outlook for crude.” WTI and Brent are up 0.5% at $58.59 and $62.06 a barrel, respectively.

It's hard to do both - because lower profits mean oil companies drill less, not more.\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Fenergy%2Ftrump-pushes-drill-baby-drill-agenda-venezuela-hurts-producers-home-2026-01-09%2F)\n\nTrump has asked U.S. oil companies to fix Venezuela's oil industry and boost its production. In years gone by, access to Venezuela's vast onshore reserves - estimated to be the world's largest - would have been a once-in-a-generation opportunity.\n\nBut with oil markets well supplied, OPEC members sitting on spare capacity - and with abundant opportunities to pump oil more cheaply elsewhere - U.S. oil producer executives are facing the prospect of another hit to profits in the short term if more Venezuelan oil flows to the United States.\n\nOil prices in the U.S., the world's largest producer, are already below the $65 a barrel level many need to turn a profit, prompting mass layoffs, idled oilfield equipment and spending cuts.\n\nU.S. oil futures settled at $59.12 on Friday.\n\nU.S. oil executives, ranging from majors like Chevron and Exxon to lesser-known companies from Energy Secretary Chris Wright's home state of Colorado, were set to meet at the to discuss potential investment plans in Venezuela.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week said smaller, independent companies have expressed interest in developing the South American country's vast resources, and the U.S. government has floated the idea of subsidizing investments into the industry.\n\nThe [reality on the ground](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shale-rigs-idle-layoffs-rise-60-oil-tests-resilience-permian-2025-11-21/) for U.S. producers is stark, particularly as Trump moves Venezuelan barrels to the already well-supplied market.

Producers across the U.S. have watched the best drilling locations dry up and breakeven prices rise.\n\n\"$50 oil is really where production would start to fall,\" said Matthew Bernstein, Vice President, North America oil and gas at Rystad Energy.\n\nRystad sees onshore U.S. output, excluding Alaska, declining by around 150,000 bpd through 2026 in a $50 price environment.\n\nTechnological improvements have allowed drillers to eke out more oil at lower prices, but some analysts and industry participants have warned those improvements may be approaching their limit.\n\nThe OPEC+ producer group opted to pause production target increases for the first quarter of 2026, amid ample global supplies. OPEC could, however, start increasing output again as it seeks to take market share from U.S. shale producers.\n\nRedirecting Venezuelan barrels into the U.S. market is part of a broader effort to combat inflation by pressuring oil prices, Michael Alfaro, CIO of Gallo Partners, a regulatory - and policy-focused hedge fund said. While Trump is supportive of U.S. shale in principle, lower oil prices combined with steel tariffs, are two persistent headwinds for this group, he added.\n\n\"I’m very much in a wait-and-see mode because there are still big unanswered questions,\" said Mike Oestmann, CEO of shale producer Tall City Exploration in the Permian Basin.\n\nReporting by Georgina McCartney and Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; Editing by Liz Hampton, Simon Webb and Diane Craft\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Arathy Somasekhar](/authors/arathy-somasekhar/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nHouston-based energy reporter focused on oil markets and energy companies.

Trump has said he wants interim President Delcy Rodriguez to give the U.S. and private companies \"total access\" to Venezuela's oil industry.\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Fenergy%2Fvenezuela-us-talks-export-venezuelan-oil-us-sources-say-2026-01-06%2F)\n\nVenezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to a blockade on exports imposed by Trump since mid-December.\n\nThe blockade was part of rising U.S. pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that culminated in U.S. forces capturing him this weekend.

Sanctions mean the company is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in U.S. dollars.\n\nRodriguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday, is herself under U.S. sanctions imposed in 2018 for undermining democracy.\n\n## TALKS INVOLVE POSSIBLE AUCTIONS WITH US BUYERS\n\nThe officials have been in talks this week about possible sales mechanisms, including auctions to allow interested U.S. buyers to bid for cargoes, and issuing U.S. licenses to PDVSA's business partners that could lead to supply contracts, two sources said.\n\nThose licenses have in the past allowed PDVSA's joint venture partners and customers, including Chevron, India's Reliance [(RELI.NS), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RELI.NS), China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and European Eni [(ENI.MI), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ENI.MI) and Repsol [(REP.MC), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/REP.MC), to have access to Venezuelan oil to refine or to resell to third parties.\n\nThis week, some of those companies have begun making preparations for receiving Venezuelan cargoes again, two sources said.\n\nThe U.S. and Venezuela have also discussed if Venezuelan oil can be used in the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the future, one of the sources said.\n\n## INCREASED OIL FLOWS WOULD BE 'GREAT NEWS'\n\nU.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said on Tuesday that an increased flow of Venezuelan heavy oil to the U.S. Gulf would be \"great news\" for job security, future gasoline prices in the U.S. and for Venezuela.\n\n\"Venezuela has an opportunity now to actually have capital come in and rebuild their economy and take advantage,\" he told Fox News, when asked about this story on the talks between the governments on oil exports. \"With American technology, American partnership, Venezuela can be transformed.\"\n\nU.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast can process Venezuela's heavy crude grades and were importing some 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) before Washington first imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela.\n\nPDVSA has already had to cut production due to the embargo, because it is running out of storage for the oil.

The US slows on weaker capex and energy sector retrenchment, Europe grapples with stagnant industrial output, and emerging markets face terms-of-trade headwinds.

The broader Canadian economy slows into recession, with spillovers to transport, equipment manufacturing, and regional services.</p><p><strong>Policy and asset prices adjust</strong>. With inflation easing and slack building, the Bank of Canada moves to support demand through measured rate cuts.

Energy HY spreads widen, primary issuance slows, and advisory activity moderates. Trading revenue is mixed, with credit valuation adjustments and widened spreads impacting results, while FX and rates desks benefit from hedging activity.

Any resemblances to actual future events are purely coincidental. This scenario is plausible, but certainly not inevitable. It is offered in the modest hope that it will inspire and inform efforts to prevent the disastrous outcome described here.\n\nIt is January 2028. Looking back, the Americans did not “take” Greenland—not in any concrete sense. There was no invasion, no purchase, not even a plebiscite. But in the shadowy corridors of Arctic politics, Washington moved deliberately to confound its opponents. The Americanization of Greenland transcended brute imperial force in the Russian mold.\n\nTwo years earlier, in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s showy military ouster of Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro—and Trump’s insistence that he intended to take over Greenland next—foreign policy analysts had been scrambling to imagine how he might seize the island. Would he force Denmark to sell its semiautonomous territory? Send in the troops, effectively attacking a NATO ally? But Trump didn’t have to do either. Instead, his administration pioneered a new form of twenty-first-century imperialism in which sovereignty over territory is imposed less by force than by function, through investments, contractors, and legal ambiguities. In the process, Trump’s Greenland gambit rewrote the rules of international order and created a template that Beijing, Moscow, and others soon followed. Now known as “geo-osmosis,” what follows is the story of how it happened.\n\n### **FROM TROLLING TO TRUTH**\n\nTrump originally floated the idea of acquiring Greenland in his first term. The 2019 revelation that he had inquired about purchasing the territory from Denmark was met with global bemusement and a curt “Greenland is not for sale” response from the Danish and Greenlandic governments. Few in Brussels, Copenhagen, or Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, took the threat seriously. After all, Trump had long trafficked in hyperbolic bombast.\n\nSeasoned Trump observers noted, however, that the idea of territorial acquisition had long held a special place in Trump’s worldview. Greenland grabbed Trump’s attention as “essentially, a big real estate deal,” as he put it, an accomplishment that the journalists Peter Baker and Susan Glasser note in a 2022 book “might give him a place in American history like William Seward’s purchase of Alaska from Russia.”\n\nEarly in his second term, Trump revived the proposal and gave it a geopolitical rationale. His argument that the United States should control Greenland had three pillars: It would help the country secure critical resources—the island is estimated to have enormous oil and gas reserves as well as troves of rare-earth minerals such as cobalt, graphite, and lithium. It would expand the U.S. military’s reach in the Arctic. And it would limit Chinese and Russian influence in a territory key to U.S. national security.\n\nBut when Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen offered to give the U.S. president more or less anything he wanted short of sovereignty to achieve those goals, Trump simply refused. It became clear that he was not actually interested in Arctic security. Rather, Greenland became the first in a series of Trumpian territorial ambitions that included Canada, the Panama Canal, and even the Gaza Strip—acquisitions that he apparently believed might secure his place on Mount Rushmore.\n\nAs was so often the case with Trump, it was difficult to separate the trolling from the truth. But it soon emerged that Greenland was a genuine target. With a more loyal second-term team ready to carry out his whims and a supine Congress, his administration was able to create a plan to make his desire a reality.\n\n### **ABSORB AND CONQUER**\n\nIn Greenland, the Trump administration lifted a few elements from its Venezuela template: for instance, the administration directed U.S. spy agencies to step up efforts to identify people in Greenland and Denmark who could support their objectives for the island, just as it leaned on the CIA to help overthrow Maduro. But Trump’s apparatchiks quickly concluded that the best way to control Greenland was not to follow the Venezuela model or to buy Greenland. Regardless of its immediate success, overt military action against a NATO ally would only ignite local and global opposition and limit the United States’ ability to assert sovereignty over the island. But they could control it by cleverly exploiting its supply dependencies.\n\nThe administration understood that Greenland was economically and politically fragile. At 56,000 people, its population was 500 times smaller than Venezuela’s. Manhattan’s East Village had more residents. A mostly uninhabitable ice sheet a quarter of the size of the U.S. mainland, its people were scattered and its infrastructure spotty; with only 93 miles of roads, many Greenlandic communities could reach the others only by boat, small plane, snowmobile, or dogsled, and less than 70 percent of the population used the Internet. Greenlanders had long resented Danish rule and accused the Danish government of keeping them poor and dependent. The island’s semiautonomous government, limited budgetary sovereignty, and simmering independence movement—most Greenlandic political parties ostensibly wanted the territory to gain full autonomy—made it highly susceptible to external influence. Add to this a thin institutional infrastructure and a lack of indigenous wealth, and you had an ideal laboratory for what Trump officials at the time termed “motivated alignment.”\n\nA planning cell in the White House began drafting what was euphemistically titled the Northern Strategic Realignment Initiative. With information from U.S. spy agencies in hand, in May 2026, the Trump administration announced a $10 billion “strategic development initiative” for Greenland, ostensibly to upgrade infrastructure and promote the exploitation of the island’s natural resources.\n\n> The Americans did not need the Greenlandic population’s consent.\n\nWashington moved through proxies. A patchwork of development consortiums, disaster response teams, nongovernmental organizations, consultants, and Arctic energy forums, almost all boasting loose ties to Trump-aligned donors or U.S. government funding, descended on Greenland in the summer of 2026. The activities of these polite people were ostensibly civilian: installing broadband, training local officials, or building roads, small airports, and health centers. Investment was deployed not nationally but municipally. Coastal communities received critical supplies, construction contracts, and digital infrastructure grants. The money came with no overt political strings, but it did have an accompanying series of technical agreements and memorandums that quietly shifted local loyalties and forced budgetary dependence.\n\nThis flurry of help and investment did not fool most Greenlanders. As early as January 2025, a survey jointly commissioned by Danish and Greenlandic newspapers showed that over 85 percent of the island’s residents opposed Greenland’s incorporation into the United States, and those numbers never changed very much. Greenlanders feared the erosion of their culture and autonomy, not to mention having to navigate the nightmare of the U.S. health-care system. But some of Greenland’s government officials and community leaders, long frustrated by Copenhagen’s paternalism and budget constraints, found themselves tempted by these American offers.\n\nThus, the U.S. efforts set the terms of Greenland’s next political phase. The Americans funded local media. They offered fellowships to emerging political leaders. Washington pushed a framing of Greenlandic identity in opposition to Danish “colonialism”—and as compatible with U.S. patronage. Ultimately, the Americans did not need the population’s consent. They just needed a few collaborators amid a general sense of fatigue and cynicism with politics as usual—an attitude Trump’s team is skilled at seeding.\n\n### **FEALTY FOLLOWS FUNCTION**\n\nThe sovereignty campaign was therefore not one of persuasion. It was one of circumvention and absorption. Trump’s advisers understood that Greenland’s democratic mechanisms could be rerouted by fragmenting the elite, creating greater economic dependence, and generating a need for emergency governance. Danish resupply routes began to face delays as ships were stopped and searched at sea. Fuel shortages, medical supply bottlenecks, and bureaucratic “miscommunications” caused by unexplained electricity and Internet outages pushed municipalities toward the only actors offering an alternative: the Americans.\n\nAround 150 U.S. service members had already been stationed at Pituffik Space Base in northern Greenland. But acting on humanitarian grounds, the U.S. military rapidly expanded its footprint. Emergency logistics hubs became new de facto bases. U.S. contractors took over local security training. By October, several Greenlandic lawmakers had formed a “Sovereign Future Caucus,” signaling their openness to “alternative security and economic partnerships.” One Trump adviser described it as “the Taiwan model in reverse: build deep ties first and let the sovereignty claims follow.”\n\nBy early 2027, Greenland was operating in a sovereignty twilight. Formally, it was still part of the Danish realm, but it had become functionally dependent on a U.S. presidential administration that had not even bothered to try to secure Greenlandic popular support.\n\n> Greenland’s democratic mechanisms could be rerouted.\n\nTo move from de facto integration toward de jure sovereignty, the U.S. Justice Department assembled a legal framework that invoked historical precedent. Drawing on the 1917 U.S. purchase of the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands), and citing Greenland’s right to self-determination under the UN Charter, Trump administration lawyers constructed what they called a sovereignty transition plan.\n\nThe Trump team avoided a national referendum, knowing it would fail. Instead, the administration encouraged the Greenlandic parliament to adopt a declaration of “provisional autonomy” and offered Washington’s recognition of Greenlandic sovereignty in principle. It was a phrase loaded with possibilities and devoid of obligations. A letter of support from pro-American Greenlandic officials, signed in July 2027, set the plan in motion. The U.S. then formally beganstationing U.S. security forces in Nuuk, using the letter to claim that they had been invited by the Greenlandic parliament, even though no vote had been held.\n\nIn October 2027, Greenland’s parliament declared provisional autonomy and an “interim sovereignty transition.” The United States raised its flag over new “civil-military liaison offices” in Nuuk and Greenland’s three next-largest towns. Negotiations to grant Greenland a compact of free association, akin to those the United States has with Micronesia or the Marshall Islands, began immediately afterward.\n\n### **EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN**\n\nThese efforts, of course, ignited a firestorm in Denmark. The Danish government declared the sovereignty transition plan a “hostile act” and withdrew its ambassador from Washington. The European Union denounced it as a violation of international law. The French president called it “a colonial anachronism wrapped in nationalist theatrics.” But Denmark had little military or economic leverage to wield. And the EU, more focused on managing other elements of its strained relationship with the United States, was unwilling to do anything beyond “monitoring the situation.”\n\nMeanwhile, Russian bombers conducted patrols near Greenlandic airspace. Chinese state media outlets declared the United States a “rogue imperialist actor,” even as many of their diplomats took notes. But these efforts only strengthened Trump’s case that the United States needed to control Greenland to protect it—and shore up U.S. national security.\n\nThe Greenland gambit divided American public opinion: MAGA conservatives hailed Trump’s move as a “strategic masterstroke,” while critics likened it to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and warned that the United States’ global credibility had suffered irreparably. But the administration’s media machine lurched into action, launching a public relations campaign called “America’s Frozen Frontier,” and Fox News aired segments with AI-generated images of Greenlandic children waving U.S. flags. Maps were redrawn. Trump rallies in Michigan and Pennsylvania featured chants of “Make Greenland Great Again.” The Trump Organization announced plans to make the island the “biggest, most beautiful winter resort” in human history, with fjord-based heli-skiing and extensive glamping opportunities.\n\nDenmark challenged the United States’ moves at the International Court of Justice, but the case languished in procedural purgatory, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed it as “nonsense.” Indigenous Greenlandic voices remained split: although some elites embraced U.S. investments, most residents warned of coming environmental degradation and cultural erasure. None of that mattered. U.S. contractors continued to deliver services. Washington concluded its association compact with Nuuk, assumed full authority over Greenland’s defense and security affairs, and asserted a claim that Greenland represented a U.S. “special economic zone.” Trump declared victory.\n\n### **THE COLD BENEATH THE ICE**\n\nDecades later, the Greenland gambit would be studied as the prototype for a new form of state expansion, one that blurs the lines between consent, coercion, and capitulation. The Trump administration showed that territory need not be seized when it can be absorbed. It affirmed a simple truth of twenty-first-century geopolitics: in the absence of coherent international resistance, norms matter little; facts on the ground suffice. Commentators drew a direct line from the Trump team’s effort in Greenland to the later Russian absorption of Georgia and, of course, the Chinese takeover of Taiwan.\n\nIt also redefined the nature of international order and sovereignty. Manufactured dependence was no longer considered a form of imperialism; they became a method for building fraternal ties. Indigenous populations no longer determined sovereignty; supply chains did. And, perhaps most tellingly, the unimaginable became more than just possible.

She added that his team is weighing a range of options — including the possibility of using military force.\n\nChinese authorities have [pushed back](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202601/t20260105_11806736.html). On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized Washington for \"using the so-called 'China threat' as a pretext for itself to seek selfish gains.\"\n\n## Frozen frontiers\n\nChina described itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in its [2018 official Arctic Policy](https://english.www.gov.cn/archive/white_paper/2018/01/26/content_281476026660336.htm), asserting its right to use resources and develop shipping routes in the Arctic.\n\nState-linked Chinese firms have also invested heavily in Arctic energy projects and developed maritime routes that could reduce shipping times between Asia and Europe.\n\n\"China would push back hard against any U.S. move to take control of Greenland, given Beijing's commercial interests on the island — from resource exploration to the security of Arctic shipping routes,\" said Xinbo Wu, director at the Center for American Studies at Shanghai-based Fudan University.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department [has identified China and Russia as key competitors](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3855787/now-the-hard-part-implementing-arctic-strategy/) in the region, pointing to their expanded military capabilities and joint naval patrols as risks to national security.\n\nBeijing could seek to raise costs for Washington through multilateral diplomacy and may deepen military cooperation with Russia in the Arctic region to deter the U.S., Wu said.\n\n\"We are really getting into uncharted territory and we have to be extremely careful,\" said Henry Wang, founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization, a think-tank that often aligns with Beijing's thinking.\n\n\"The international community has to work together now and probably stop this kind of unilateral approach.\"\n\n## Energy, rare earths, infrastructure\n\nBeijing's main interests in Greenland mirror those of the U.S.: [rare earths](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/greenland-rare-earths-us-china-processing-reality-mining-arctic-shipping-lanes-route-critical-minerals.html), uranium and zinc, said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group.\n\nGreenland, a vast and sparsely populated autonomous Danish territory, hosts several large rare-earth element deposits, with some discovered mines ranking [among the world's largest](https://eng.geus.dk/media/13174/go29.pdf). These minerals are crucial for high-tech industries, from electric vehicles to defense equipment.\n\nBesides the U.S. and China, the [European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6166) has also tried to secure access to these critical mineral supplies.\n\nChinese investors have grown \"much more cautious\" about Greenland in recent years amid rising geopolitical uncertainty, said Patrik Andersson, an analyst at the Swedish National China Center at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs.\n\nDenmark retains the legal authority to block foreign investments on national security grounds.\n\nIn 2016, a Hong Kong-linked firm attempted to acquire a former Danish naval base and related port facilities, prompting Copenhagen to block the sale. A Chinese state-owned firm also withdrew its bid for an airport construction contract worth 3.6 billion Danish kroner ($563 million) in 2019 after Greenland chose Denmark over Beijing to finance the project.\n\nAndersson noted that in some cases, Chinese interest in Greenland's minerals appeared to have already declined before the recent rise in geopolitical risk, in part due to the high costs of operating in Greenland.\n\n\"From a commercial standpoint, Chinese investors may see more attractive opportunities elsewhere,\" he added.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO6:3606:36\n\nTrump's Greenland ambitions are a wake up call: Chinese think tank\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nSome Chinese-backed projects in Greenland have also stalled over environmental concerns.\n\nChinese state-affiliated company [Shenghe Resources](/quotes/392-SZ/) acquired a stake in [the Kvanefjeld project in south](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2020/presence-before-power/4-greenland-what-is-china-doing-there-and-why/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20Kvanefjeld,Kvanefjeld%20site.%EF%BB%BF%5B75%5D)[ern Greenland in 2016](https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20161031/pdf/43ch5gzhvhrmhq.pdf). The project, which was set to become one of the world's largest rare-earth and uranium mines, was halted after Greenland [reinstated a ban](https://archive.is/3cbEl) on uranium mining in 2021.\n\nWhile some analysts have estimated Chinese investments in the Arctic at over $90 billion and described them as \"unconstrained,\" Harvard University's Kennedy School said the figures are \"highly exaggerated\" because they included failed investments and unbuilt projects.\n\nAccording to [Harvard's estimates](https://www.belfercenter.org/research-analysis/china-arctic-investments) in June 2025, most of the mineral, oil and gas resource projects in Greenland with Chinese backing had been paused or canceled.\n\nDespite those setbacks, Greenland [opened its representation office in Beijing in 2023](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-10-28/VHJhbnNjcmlwdDc1NTc3/index.html) as the Arctic country sought to deepen ties with Beijing.\n\n## 'Polar Silk Road'\n\nChina has eyes on new shipping routes opening up as melting ice opens shorter paths between Asia and Europe. China's exports to the European Union, its second-largest trading bloc, [grew 8.1% year-on-year](http://www.customs.gov.cn/customs/2025-12/08/article_2025122717403341061.html) in the first eleven months of 2025.\n\nBeijing formally introduced the \"Polar Silk Road\" in its 2018 Arctic policy white paper and launched its [first Arctic shipping route to Europe](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202509/1344211.shtml) in September 2025, cutting transit times to about 20 days, roughly half the time needed for a journey through [the Suez Canal](https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/p/0P9505FV.html).\n\nThe alternative sea route presents not only \"immense economic opportunities\" for Beijing through faster trade and access to untapped natural resources, but also a \"strategic challenge to the United States' dominance of global sea lanes,\" said Zoha Fatima, a researcher focused on Arctic governance and geopolitics.\n\nChina has also expanded Arctic research efforts over the years, supporting discoveries related to sea ice composition, space weather and marine life.\n\nBuilding on existing projects in Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland, China has also [planned a research](https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/online-analysis/2020/02/china-arctic/) and satellite ground station in Greenland.\n\nThese facilities are crucial for China's Beidou navigation satellite system, developed as an alternative to the U.S.'s GPS system.\n\nChina's polar research programs have raised security concerns in the Arctic. In 2022, the Biden administration [asserted that](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/National-Strategy-for-the-Arctic-Region.pdf) China used its scientific engagements to conduct \"dual-use research with intelligence or military applications.\"\n\n\"If Trump were to take Greenland, Beijing would frame this as U.S. unilateralism and North Atlantic militarization, while stressing respect for Danish-Greenlandic autonomy and UN-based rules,\" said Eurasia's Wang.\n\n*— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng, Emily Tan contributed to this story.*",

But the crisis has exposed an uncomfortable reality - Denmark is [rallying support](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-move-greenland-2026-01-07/) to protect a territory whose population wants independence, and whose largest opposition party now wants to bypass Copenhagen and [negotiate directly with Washington](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-should-hold-talks-with-us-without-denmark-opposition-leader-says-2026-01-08/).\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fdenmarks-greenland-dilemma-defending-territory-already-its-way-out-2026-01-10%2F)\n\n\"Denmark risks exhausting its foreign policy capital to secure Greenland, only to watch it walk away afterwards,\" said Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen, a political science professor at University of Copenhagen.\n\n## STRATEGIC RELEVANCE\n\nDenmark cannot let Greenland go without losing its [geopolitical relevance](https://www.reuters.com/world/why-does-trump-want-greenland-could-he-get-it-2025-01-08/) in the [Arctic territory](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GREENLAND-ELECTION/MAPS/zjvqaeledvx/), strategically located between Europe and North America and a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system.\n\nYet it may ultimately have nothing to show for its efforts if [Greenlanders choose independence](https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland/) - or strike their own deal with Washington.\n\nThe stakes extend beyond Denmark's national interests. European allies have rallied behind Denmark not just out of solidarity, but because giving up Greenland would set a dangerous precedent that could embolden other powers to pursue territorial claims against smaller nations, upending the post-1945 world order.\n\nDenmark's foreign ministry declined to comment, but referred to joint remarks by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on December 22.\n\n\"National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,\" the two leaders said. \"They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country ... Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.\"\n\nThis week, Frederiksen said: \"If the U.S. chooses to attack another NATO country, everything stops, including NATO and the security the alliance has provided since World War Two.\"\n\n## THE 'GREENLAND CARD'\n\nFor now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table, including buying the territory or taking it by force.\n\nCopenhagen professor Rasmussen said any discussion of whether holding on to Greenland is worth the cost has been drowned out by outrage at Trump's threats.\n\n\"It is not part of the political debate in Denmark. I fear we have gone into patriotic overdrive,\" he said.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Greenland's strategic location gave Denmark outsized influence in Washington and allowed it to maintain lower defence spending than would otherwise be expected of a NATO ally.\n\nThis became known as \"the Greenland Card\", according to a 2017 report by the University of Copenhagen's Centre for Military Studies.\n\nBut Greenland's aspirations for self-determination have been brewing since the former colony got greater autonomy and its own parliament in 1979. A 2009 agreement explicitly recognised Greenlanders' right to independence if they choose.\n\nAll Greenlandic parties say they want independence, but differ on how, and when, to achieve it.\n\nTrump's pressure has accelerated a timeline that was already in motion, forcing Copenhagen to spend political capital and financial resources on a relationship with an increasingly uncertain endpoint.\n\n\"How much should we fight for someone who doesn't really care about us?\" Joachim B. Olsen, a political commentator and former Danish lawmaker, told Reuters.\n\n## THE FINANCIAL BURDEN\n\nCopenhagen provides an annual block grant of roughly 4.3 billion Danish crowns ($610 million) to Greenland's economy, which is near stagnation with GDP growth of just 0.2% in 2025.\n\nThe central bank estimates an annual financing gap of approximately 800 million Danish crowns to make current public finances sustainable. Denmark also covers police, the justice system and defence - bringing total annual spending to just under $1 billion.\n\nIn addition, Copenhagen last year announced a 42 billion Danish crowns ($6.54 billion) [Arctic defence package](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/denmark-boost-arctic-defence-by-426-billion-greenland-government-says-2025-10-10/) in response to U.S. criticism that Denmark has not done enough to protect Greenland.\n\nSome reject framing the relationship in [transactional terms](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/can-us-put-price-tag-greenland-2026-01-09/), pointing to Denmark's legal and moral obligations under international law and centuries of shared history.\n\n\"We're talking about family relations, long history of relations between Denmark and Greenland,\" said Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. \"So this is much more, it's not just about defence and economy, it's about feelings, it's about culture.\"\n\n## DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT\n\nPrime Minister Frederiksen faces a difficult balancing act, said Serafima Andreeva, researcher at Oslo-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute.\n\nFor now, Denmark has little choice but to stand firm to maintain its diplomatic credibility, but in doing so risks the relationship with the United States at a time \"when Russia is an accelerating threat and being on the U.S.'s bad side is no good for anyone in the West\".\n\nFrederiksen also faces an election this year, though Greenland has not been a major theme.\n\n\"I don't understand why we have to cling to this community with Greenland when they so badly want out of it,\" Lone Frank, a Danish science writer and broadcaster, told Reuters. \"To be completely honest, Greenland doesn't inspire any sense of belonging in me.\"\n\nReporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen; additional reporting by Soren Sirich Jeppesen and Tom Little; Editing by Alex Richardson\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen](/authors/jacob-gronholt-pedersen/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nBased in Copenhagen, Jacob oversees reporting from Denmark, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

As for other global powers, while [Russia is conspicuously quiet](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/russia-moscow-reaction-trump-greenland-takeover-ambitions.html) — probably because it is more interested in seeing any division in NATO over this affair — [China is keenly watching developments](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/us-trump-china-greenland-denmark-arctic-tensions-trump-rare-earth-elements-minerals-mining.html), having described itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in 2018. Any transaction — or operation — on this scale will have global repercussions.\n\n## What you need to know today\n\n**U.S. considering investing in mining projects in Greenland.** Amaroq, which operates on the island, said the White House is talking to it about [investment in its projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/-greenland-critical-minerals-mining-amaroq-us-government.html) that extract or explore gold, gallium and other critical mineral deposits.\n\n**Trump administration races to come up with Greenland takeover plan.** U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubiois set to [meet Denmark officials](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/greenland-rubio-denmark-trump.html) next week to discuss the situation. Here are [four key issues surrounding](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/greenland-trump-takeover-bid-denmark-what-happens-next.html) the meeting.\n\n**Chinese inflation accelerates in December.** The country's [consumer price index rose 0.8%](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/china-december-inflation-cpi-ppi-prices-demand-weakness.html) from a year earlier, as expected by a Reuters poll of economists. That's the highest level since Feb. 2023. However, inflation was flat for 2025 as a whole.\n\n**Divergence between U.S. indexes.** The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/quotes/.DJI/) roseThursday but the [Nasdaq Composite](/quotes/.IXIC/) slid as [investors rotated out of tech](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html). [Asia-Pacific markets mostly advanced](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/asia-pacific-markets-china-cpi-hang-seng-index-kospi-nikkei-225.html) Friday. Australia's [Rio Tinto](/quotes/RIO-AU/) had its worst day since 2022 on news it had entered buyout talks with [Glencore](/quotes/GLEN-GB/). Meanwhile, Asian defense stocks broadly climbed.\n\n**[PRO] Venezuela bond bets pay off.** Lee Robinson, founder and chief investment officer of distressed debt investor Altana Wealth, captured returns of 30% in Venezuelan bonds after the U.S. attack on the country. Robinson said there's [\"more upside\" to come.](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/venezuela-maduro-oil-trump-overthrow-russia-china-hedge-fund.html)\n\n## And finally...\n\n[**Trump is desperate to take Greenland. Can NATO defend itself — and is it willing to?**](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/nato-trump-greenland-war-invade-defense.html)\n\nEurope spent much of 2025 scrambling to bolster its defenses against Russia — but just a week into the new year, it's being forced to rethink security once again amid U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to annex Greenland.\n\nOn Monday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned an American takeover of Greenland would spell the end of NATO. Of NATO's 32 members, 23 – including Denmark – are also members of the European Union, which has been working extensively to ensure Trump's administration continues its [support for Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/12/ukraine-war-trump-frustrated-amid-warning-putin-can-escalate-conflict.html).\n\n*— Chloe Taylor*\n\nGet the CNBC Daily Open report in your inbox every morning and keep up to date with the markets wherever you are.\n\n[APAC Edition](https://www.cnbc.com/newsletter/daily-open-apac/) [EMEA Edition](https://www.cnbc.com/newsletter/daily-open-emea/)\n\n## [More In Daily Open](https://www.cnbc.com/daily-open/)\n\n[CNBC Daily Open: U.S. moves over Greenland are heating up quickly](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/cnbc-daily-open-us-moves-over-greenland-are-heating-up-quickly.html)\n\n[Yeo Boon Ping](https://www.cnbc.com/yeo-boon-ping/)\n\n[CNBC Daily Open: Magnificent Seven competition heats up](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/cnbc-daily-open-magnificent-seven-competition-heats-up.html)\n\n[Yeo Boon Ping](https://www.cnbc.com/yeo-boon-ping/)\n\n[CNBC Daily Open: Rumbles within the Magnificent Seven](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/cnbc-daily-open-rumbles-within-the-magnificent-seven.html)\n\n[Yeo Boon Ping](https://www.cnbc.com/yeo-boon-ping/)\n\n[Read More](https://www.cnbc.com/daily-open/ \"Read More\")",

              "content": "Updated \n ET\n\n0952 ET – News that the U.S. will take up to 50 million barrels of sanctioned Venezuelan crude is pressuring WTI over Brent, as the heavy oil is seen ending up with U.S. Gulf coast refiners. “This isn’t increasing the supply of oil from Venezuela, simply redirecting it,” Simon Lack, portfolio manager of the Catalyst Energy Infrastructure Fund says in a note. “China, the biggest buyer, will need to replace those shipments. So it shouldn’t do much for oil prices although it does indicate the beginnings of a constructive dialogue on oil.” It may benefit U.S. refiners “who will receive more of the heavy crude they are set up for,” he adds. WTI is down 1.1% at $56.49 a barrel, and Brent if off 0.6% at $60.32.(anthony.harrup@wsj.com) [...] 1149 GMT – Oil prices recoup some losses but continue to trade lower, with focus on geopolitical developments in Venezuela and Ukraine. President Trump said Venezuela would turn over as much as 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the U.S. as he pushes for more control of the country’s oil sector. Meanwhile, the U.K. and France said they will set up military hubs across Ukraine if a cease-fire agreement with Russia is reached, offering some of the clearest details so far of the security guarantees Western allies will offer Kyiv. However, “while this is seen as a crucial step towards a peace agreement by Ukraine, it might turn out to be a no-go for Russia,” analysts at DNB say. Brent crude slips 0.3% to $60.51 a barrel, while WTI is down 0.6% to $56.81 a barrel.

So it shouldn’t do much for oil prices although it does indicate the beginnings of a constructive dialogue on oil.” It may benefit U.S. refiners “who will receive more of the heavy crude they are set up for,” he adds. WTI is down 1.1% at $56.49 a barrel, and Brent if off 0.6% at $60.32.([anthony.harrup@wsj.com](mailto:anthony.harrup@wsj.com))\n\n### Oil Slips as Traders Weigh Venezuela, Ukraine Developments\n\n1149 GMT – Oil prices recoup some losses but continue to trade lower, with focus on geopolitical developments in Venezuela and Ukraine. President Trump said Venezuela would turn over as much as 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the U.S. as he pushes for more control of the country’s oil sector. Meanwhile, the U.K. and France said they will set up military hubs across Ukraine if a cease-fire agreement with Russia is reached, offering some of the clearest details so far of the security guarantees Western allies will offer Kyiv. However, “while this is seen as a crucial step towards a peace agreement by Ukraine, it might turn out to be a no-go for Russia,” analysts at DNB say. Brent crude slips 0.3% to $60.51 a barrel, while WTI is down 0.6% to $56.81 a barrel. ([giulia.petroni@wsj.com](mailto:giulia.petroni@wsj.com))\n\nCopyright ©2026 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

If the U.S. were to lift sanctions on Venezuelan oil it could release barrels “and only add to the surplus that the market is already experiencing,” says Mizuho’s Robert Yawger. A substantial increase in Venezuelan production is widely expected to be a long-term prospect, although from around 1 million barrels a day at present “Venezuela could get to 1.5 million rather quickly,” Yawger says. “And I think Gulf coast refiners would be happy to take those barrels.” WTI settles down 2% at $57.13 a barrel, compared with $57.32 Friday. Brent falls 1.7% to $60.70 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com) [...] ### Crude Futures Ease Back From Early Gains\n\n1057 ET – Oil futures relinquish early gains with the market still weighing the implications of developments in Venezuela, while concerns about oversupply in 2026 remain. The ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro may have briefly camouflaged those concerns, but “I suspect the veil is going to be lifted again,” says Societe Generale’s Ben Hoff. “We’re going to have to face the hard reality that we are looking at a wall of crude heading onshore, something I think has been on people’s minds,” he adds. Crude’s move higher in the wake of the U.S. operation to remove Maduro was “more short-term market sentiment than anything fundamental,” he says.

If the U.S. were to lift sanctions on Venezuelan oil it could release barrels “and only add to the surplus that the market is already experiencing,” says Mizuho’s Robert Yawger. A substantial increase in Venezuelan production is widely expected to be a long-term prospect, although from around 1 million barrels a day at present “Venezuela could get to 1.5 million rather quickly,” Yawger says. “And I think Gulf coast refiners would be happy to take those barrels.” WTI settles down 2% at $57.13 a barrel, compared with $57.32 Friday. Brent falls 1.7% to $60.70 a barrel. ([anthony.harrup@wsj.com](mailto:anthony.harrup@wsj.com))\n\n### Crude Futures Ease Back From Early Gains\n\n1057 ET – Oil futures relinquish early gains with the market still weighing the implications of developments in Venezuela, while concerns about oversupply in 2026 remain. The ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro may have briefly camouflaged those concerns, but “I suspect the veil is going to be lifted again,” says Societe Generale’s Ben Hoff. “We’re going to have to face the hard reality that we are looking at a wall of crude heading onshore, something I think has been on people’s minds,” he adds. Crude’s move higher in the wake of the U.S. operation to remove Maduro was “more short-term market sentiment than anything fundamental,” he says. WTI is off 0.1% at $58.26 a barrel and Brent is near flat at $61.75.([anthony.harrup@wsj.com](mailto:anthony.harrup@wsj.com))\n\nCopyright ©2026 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The country’s energy infrastructure is in a dire state and tens of billions of investment will be needed to get things back up and running, Michael Brown of Pepperstone says in a note. “In any case, the extra-heavy sour nature of Venezuelan crude means the economics of extraction don’t really add up with Brent at $60 a barrel.” Any potential output increase “is a story for a much later date,” he says, and “nothing we’ve seen so far materially shifts the outlook for crude.” WTI and Brent are up 0.5% at $58.59 and $62.06 a barrel, respectively.

It's hard to do both - because lower profits mean oil companies drill less, not more.\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Fenergy%2Ftrump-pushes-drill-baby-drill-agenda-venezuela-hurts-producers-home-2026-01-09%2F)\n\nTrump has asked U.S. oil companies to fix Venezuela's oil industry and boost its production. In years gone by, access to Venezuela's vast onshore reserves - estimated to be the world's largest - would have been a once-in-a-generation opportunity.\n\nBut with oil markets well supplied, OPEC members sitting on spare capacity - and with abundant opportunities to pump oil more cheaply elsewhere - U.S. oil producer executives are facing the prospect of another hit to profits in the short term if more Venezuelan oil flows to the United States.\n\nOil prices in the U.S., the world's largest producer, are already below the $65 a barrel level many need to turn a profit, prompting mass layoffs, idled oilfield equipment and spending cuts.\n\nU.S. oil futures settled at $59.12 on Friday.\n\nU.S. oil executives, ranging from majors like Chevron and Exxon to lesser-known companies from Energy Secretary Chris Wright's home state of Colorado, were set to meet at the to discuss potential investment plans in Venezuela.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week said smaller, independent companies have expressed interest in developing the South American country's vast resources, and the U.S. government has floated the idea of subsidizing investments into the industry.\n\nThe [reality on the ground](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shale-rigs-idle-layoffs-rise-60-oil-tests-resilience-permian-2025-11-21/) for U.S. producers is stark, particularly as Trump moves Venezuelan barrels to the already well-supplied market.

Producers across the U.S. have watched the best drilling locations dry up and breakeven prices rise.\n\n\"$50 oil is really where production would start to fall,\" said Matthew Bernstein, Vice President, North America oil and gas at Rystad Energy.\n\nRystad sees onshore U.S. output, excluding Alaska, declining by around 150,000 bpd through 2026 in a $50 price environment.\n\nTechnological improvements have allowed drillers to eke out more oil at lower prices, but some analysts and industry participants have warned those improvements may be approaching their limit.\n\nThe OPEC+ producer group opted to pause production target increases for the first quarter of 2026, amid ample global supplies. OPEC could, however, start increasing output again as it seeks to take market share from U.S. shale producers.\n\nRedirecting Venezuelan barrels into the U.S. market is part of a broader effort to combat inflation by pressuring oil prices, Michael Alfaro, CIO of Gallo Partners, a regulatory - and policy-focused hedge fund said. While Trump is supportive of U.S. shale in principle, lower oil prices combined with steel tariffs, are two persistent headwinds for this group, he added.\n\n\"I’m very much in a wait-and-see mode because there are still big unanswered questions,\" said Mike Oestmann, CEO of shale producer Tall City Exploration in the Permian Basin.\n\nReporting by Georgina McCartney and Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; Editing by Liz Hampton, Simon Webb and Diane Craft\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Arathy Somasekhar](/authors/arathy-somasekhar/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nHouston-based energy reporter focused on oil markets and energy companies.

Trump has said he wants interim President Delcy Rodriguez to give the U.S. and private companies \"total access\" to Venezuela's oil industry.\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Fenergy%2Fvenezuela-us-talks-export-venezuelan-oil-us-sources-say-2026-01-06%2F)\n\nVenezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to a blockade on exports imposed by Trump since mid-December.\n\nThe blockade was part of rising U.S. pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that culminated in U.S. forces capturing him this weekend. Top Venezuelan officials have called Maduro's capture a kidnapping and accused the U.S. of trying to steal the country's vast oil reserves.\n\nA potential deal to sell the trapped crude to the U.S. could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources said.

Sanctions mean the company is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in U.S. dollars.\n\nRodriguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday, is herself under U.S. sanctions imposed in 2018 for undermining democracy.\n\n## TALKS INVOLVE POSSIBLE AUCTIONS WITH US BUYERS\n\nThe officials have been in talks this week about possible sales mechanisms, including auctions to allow interested U.S. buyers to bid for cargoes, and issuing U.S. licenses to PDVSA's business partners that could lead to supply contracts, two sources said.\n\nThose licenses have in the past allowed PDVSA's joint venture partners and customers, including Chevron, India's Reliance [(RELI.NS), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RELI.NS), China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and European Eni [(ENI.MI), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ENI.MI) and Repsol [(REP.MC), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/REP.MC), to have access to Venezuelan oil to refine or to resell to third parties.\n\nThis week, some of those companies have begun making preparations for receiving Venezuelan cargoes again, two sources said.\n\nThe U.S. and Venezuela have also discussed if Venezuelan oil can be used in the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the future, one of the sources said.\n\n## INCREASED OIL FLOWS WOULD BE 'GREAT NEWS'\n\nU.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said on Tuesday that an increased flow of Venezuelan heavy oil to the U.S. Gulf would be \"great news\" for job security, future gasoline prices in the U.S. and for Venezuela.\n\n\"Venezuela has an opportunity now to actually have capital come in and rebuild their economy and take advantage,\" he told Fox News, when asked about this story on the talks between the governments on oil exports. \"With American technology, American partnership, Venezuela can be transformed.\"\n\nU.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast can process Venezuela's heavy crude grades and were importing some 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) before Washington first imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela.\n\nPDVSA has already had to cut production due to the embargo, because it is running out of storage for the oil. If PDVSA does not find a way to export oil soon, it would have to cut production more, one of the sources said.\n\nOil traders reacted to news of the talks on Tuesday.

Greater reliance on exports raises exposure to tariffs and trade tensions, Rhodium added.\n\nA tower crane stands above residential buildings in an urban district in the afternoon light, on January 9,

economy more exposed to trade tensions, U.S.-based research firm Rhodium Group said in a report Monday.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2025, new industries such as artificial intelligence, robotics and electric cars added just 0.8 percentage points to economic output, while real estate and other traditional sectors saw a combined 6 percentage point decline, the report said. The analysis drew on official Chinese data and industry-specific sources.\n\nThe findings come as China seeks to boost technological self-reliance in response to U.S. restrictions. Under a five-year development plan set to kick off in earnest in March, [Beijing is doubling down on advanced technologies](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/china-to-bolster-consumption-tech-development-as-us-tensions-simmer.html) with state investment and favorable policies.\n\n\"China's growth strategy isn't going to work,\" Logan Wright, partner at Rhodium and a co-author of the report, told CNBC. \"They're not going to achieve their targeted rates of GDP growth based on the policies they have outlined so far.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO8:0408:04\n\nMorgan Stanley sees 'year of stabilization' for China markets after strong 2025\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nBeijing has targeted annual GDP growth of around 5% in recent years. For China to sustain that pace, new industries would need to expand sevenfold over the next five years to generate the roughly 2 percentage points of annual investment growth required, Rhodium estimated.\n\nThat translates to an additional 2.8 trillion yuan in new investment required this year — or 120% more than in 2025. While investment in artificial intelligence or robotics could increase in the next year or two, other emerging industries are unlikely to sustain such rapid growth, the analysts said.\n\n\"Electric vehicles have likely already reached their fastest rates of growth, and output in the industry may be slowing in the years ahead,\" the Rhodium report said.\n\n## Property drag deepens\n\nWhile Beijing has prioritized [high-tech development](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/10/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-a-rival-ai-strategy.html), it has taken fewer steps to address a yearslong slump in real estate. The sector [once accounted for more than a quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/09/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-the-hidden-drag-on-chinas-economy.html) of the economy. New home sales by floor area last year fell to levels [not seen since 2009](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-dcid0mnIi8knATU9vEyWg), according to a report last week by the China Real Estate Information Corp.\n\nOnly in recent weeks have sighs appeared that some policymakers are [considering more forceful property support](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/china-property-slump-policy-shift-qiushi-2026-ahead-march-meeting.html). China's top leaders are due to formalize economic targets for the year at an annual parliamentary meeting in March.\n\nA macro outlook published by global investment firm KKR estimated that property weakness will shave 1.2 percentage points off China's GDP growth this year. Even with a projected 2.6 percentage point contribution from digital technologies, the estimated total growth was still on the low end at 4.6%.\n\n\"Despite a potential 5% growth target for 2026, headwinds from real estate and a weak job market cast doubt on achievability,\" the report said. KKR predicts the property drag could halve in 2027, but sees limited improvement in digital industries or consumer demand.\n\n## From jobs to trade tensions\n\nAn overemphasis on tech could have broader economic consequences.\n\nNew industrial sectors may offer higher wages, but they employ far fewer people than traditional industries, the Rhodium analysis found.\n\nIncreased factory automation, coupled with China's already high 30% share of global manufacturing output, could lead to the loss of up to 100 million jobs over the next decade — a displacement that would exceed the total workforce of most developed economies, KKR said.\n\nChina's urban unemployment rate remained [above 5%](http://english.scio.gov.cn/pressroom/2025-12/15/content_118228465.html) for much of last year, while youth unemployment has been [about three times higher.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/17/china-youth-unemployment-civil-service-jobs-economy-slowdown.html)\n\nSince it's unlikely that domestic investment, even in newer industries, will produce sufficient demand, \"Beijing will become even more dependent upon gaining market share in export markets,\" the Rhodium report said.\n\n\"China will remain even more reliant upon exports in the future, leaving the economy vulnerable to new trade restrictions,\" the report said.\n\nAs lower-priced Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, have expanded overseas, Mexico and the European Union have joined the U.S. in raising tariffs on imports from China.\n\nWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox  \n [Subscribe now](https://www.cnbc.com/lander?id=chinaconnection-newsletter)\n\nChina's economic imbalance mirrors a similar [divergence in the U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/25/ai-spending-is-boosting-the-economy-many-businesses-in-survival-mode.html), where AI-linked companies have led stock market gains, while [other parts of the economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/business/the-ai-boom-economy.html) have struggled.\n\nBut many in Beijing argue that the country has longer-term interests at stake.\n\nZhang Jianping, a deputy director at China's Commerce Ministry, told CNBC last week that the country's policies are designed to support innovation over multiple years. Traditional industries such as steel and real estate, he added, must integrate new technologies to remain competitive.",

You can subscribe*[*here.*](https://www.cnbc.com/lander?id=chinaconnection-newsletter)\n\n## The big story\n\nFor someone who's witnessed the ups and downs of U.S.-China tensions since the 1990s, James Zimmerman is unexpectedly hopeful about 2026.\n\nThis year, he's back for a fifth term as chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, whose members include [Boeing](/quotes/BA/) and Cargill. His first stint came in 2007 and 2008, when Beijing hosted its first Olympic Games, and the financial crisis hit much of the world. He later served again in 2015 and 2016, as populist movements rose globally and gave Donald Trump his first term as U.S. President.\n\nFast forward a decade, and U.S. businesses have endured everything from the pandemic to escalating tariffs. But the past decade of what Zimmerman calls \"experimenting with competition\" could now give way to something new, with Trump expected to visit China in April.\n\nThis picture taken on November 6, 2018 shows a Chinese and US flag at a booth during the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai.\n\nJohannes Eisele | AFP | Getty Images\n\n*Here are the highlights of our conversation, with responses condensed for clarity:*\n\n**Why are you staying engaged at such a high level, after nearly 30 years in China?**\n\nThe reason I'm involved is because I think this is a very important year.\n\n2026 is important, not just because [it's] the 250th anniversary of the U.S., but the U.S. and China have had 10 years of experimenting with competition, experimenting with calls for decoupling and de-risking.\n\nHas that worked? Not really. So it's now time to go back and, in a way that may be visionary, to get us back on track to have ongoing dialogues, ongoing engagement, because I think, at the end of the day, that will be in the best interest of the U.S. and China.\n\n**Are many U.S. companies decoupling from China?**\n\nNo. We're seeing an evolution. People are starting to adjust. For many sectors, China continues to be a critical market. But it's also an essential part of the global supply chain.\n\nAmerican companies are adjusting to this new normal within the U.S.-China relationship. But there has been some diversifying, and that's a healthy strategy that companies are looking at, but we are not seeing wholesale decoupling at all.\n\nIt's important that we have senior**-**level meetings that bring some clarity, some certainty, some continuity to the relationship.\n\nDialogue matters **—** even the smallest, positive signals, at the presidential level, on engagement are very, very important. Regular, ongoing engagement helps reduce any potential misunderstandings and lowers the risk of unexpected policy shocks, like the back-and-forth over tariffs.\n\n**What kind of opportunity do U.S. businesses have in China as domestic competition rises?**\n\nWe have our white paper, which, in a way, allows us to engage with the Chinese government to seek changes that are positive.\n\nProtection of intellectual property is not just an issue for foreign companies. It's also an issue for Chinese companies.\n\nBoth sides need to tone down the national security issues and not view every slight as a national security matter.\n\nWe can't have an environment where every foreigner is targeted as a potential threat. And that goes both ways: when Chinese companies go to the U.S., we can't take the view that it's a threat to the communities they want to operate in.\n\n**Is the CEO of the China operations losing influence on headquarters in the U.S.?**\n\nIt's something that needs further attention post-pandemic. But that's something that is just a circumstance, especially given what took place during the pandemic, when travel came to a halt.\n\nBut when you look at AmCham, the U.S.-China Business Council and the National Committee for U.S.-China Relations, there's now increased interest in making sure CEOs, academic leaders, as well as congressional leaders, travel to [China to] understand what the environment is all about.\n\nWe try to encourage more people-to-people exchanges. I'm going to be out and about in the community, emphasizing the importance of education as well as the arts. For example, I'm going to a conference at the Juilliard School in Tianjin.\n\n**What's on your agenda at AmCham China for 2026?**\n\nIn some respects**,** we're focused on April when President Trump is planning to come to China. We're hopeful that AmCham will be able to play a role in that. There is a focus on that, and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of work leading up to that visit.\n\nThere'll be some agreements, some understanding, maybe a memorandum of understanding that may come out of that.\n\nWe're not expecting a grand bargain. There just isn't enough time. It was last summer, and we were in the middle of a trade war. And only since October, President Xi, as well as President Trump, met in South Korea, have we started a process [around] let's meet, let's talk, let's keep engaging.\n\nSo I think we're on the right track, but we'll just have to see the progress between now and April. But we're optimistic the signals will come out positive.

McNeal](https://www.cnbc.com/dewardric-mcneal/)\n\n[WATCH LIVE](/live-tv/)\n\nKey Points\n\n* Trump's so-called \"Donroe Doctrine\" framing of Western Hemispheric dominance has led to concerns that China will move on Taiwan to flex its own regional muscle.\n* It is the wrong question to be asking given what has taken place in Venezuela, writes international policy expert Dewardric McNeal.\n* China sees itself as a global power with global interests, ambitions, investments, and supply-chain demands — with the agency to defend and extend those interests in America's so-called backyard.\n\nUS President Donald Trump shows a lapel pin as he speaks during a meeting with US oil companies executives in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on January 9, 2026.\n\nSaul Loeb | Afp | Getty Images\n\nThe conversation in Washington right now is abuzz with talk of [President Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)'s new National Security Strategy and its so-called \"Donroe Doctrine\" framing of Western Hemispheric dominance — a modern corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. That debate had already been simmering in policy circles before the end of last year, but it was turbocharged by the recent U.S. operation in Venezuela. Almost immediately, the familiar question resurfaced: What will China do now?\n\nMuch of that speculation has [fixated on Taiwan](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/us-venezuela-strike-taiwan-china-precedent-russia-ukraine.html). Would Beijing use U.S. kinetic action in Venezuela as justification — or precedent — for moving against the island? That question may be understandable and its implications concerning. However, many believe that it is also the wrong question to be asking.\n\nChina will not use Venezuela as a pretext to invade Taiwan. That is neither how Beijing thinks nor how it operates. Serious analysis demands setting the distraction of seeing China as a reactive power aside, and dealing with a more consequential — and far more uncomfortable — question. It requires that we read and debate China's own strategic documents about our region with the same rigor now being applied to the U.S. National Security Strategy, and take them seriously on their own terms.\n\n[China's newly issued](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202512/10/content_WS693962c3c6d00ca5f9a08069.html) third Policy Paper on Latin America and the Caribbean is not a press release or a reactive and reflexive impulse triggered by Washington. It is a longstanding, well thought out, forward-looking, and deliberately structured approach to achieving China's long-term goals. It includes the range of tools of statecraft that it intends to use, and the pathways through which it plans to sustain its influence. It is an institutional blueprint — dense with political mechanisms, financing pathways, commercial incentives, and a theory of the case for the legitimacy of its engagement and presence in the region rooted in Global South solidarity rather than overt claims of regional hegemony or 18th-century cosplay.\n\nThe [NSS](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf) is explicit about intent. It commits the United States to keeping the hemisphere free of \"hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets,\" ensuring access to \"key strategic locations,\" and denying non-hemispheric competitors' control over \"strategically vital assets.\" Venezuela, in that telling, becomes a proof point: evidence that Washington is prepared to act kinetically to alter political realities when it believes access, stability, or strategic positioning are at risk.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO13:2813:28\n\nBremmer: Trump will focus on increasing military power as it loses economically\n\n[Squawk Box Asia](https://www.cnbc.com/asia-squawk-box/)\n\nBut the Trump NSS also reveals a central analytical vulnerability. It implicitly assumes the United States can grant spheres of influence — cede a region here, consolidate one there — and that so-called \"regional powers\" will accept the arrangement. China does not see itself as a regional power. It sees itself as a global power with global interests, ambitions, investments, and supply-chain demands — and with the agency to defend and extend those interests in America's so-called backyard. The NSS can declare a corollary; it cannot declare away another major power's presence or objectives, particularly one as deeply embedded in the hemisphere as China already is. China's Latin America strategy is engineered to be resilient against exactly this kind of episodic shock.\n\n### How China exerts its influence across the globe\n\nStart with the political architecture. Beijing does not limit its engagement to trade or hydrocarbons, though both [matter a great deal to Beijing](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/china-response-us-venezuela-strike-economic-interests.html). Instead, it pursues head-of-state diplomacy, exchanges between intergovernmental committees, legislature-to-legislature exchanges, political-party engagement, and deep institutional embedding through CELAC, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, a 33-country regional political bloc coordinating cooperation across trade, finance, infrastructure, technology, and people-to-people ties. The objective is explicit: institutionalize influence across \"multi-level, multi-channel\" pathways with a structure that dilutes any single pressure point campaign by the United States. It is far harder to \"flip\" a region when influence runs so deeply through presidents, parties, parliaments, technocrats, students, consumers, and subnational actors simultaneously.\n\nThe economics reinforce that architecture. China frames its engagement — accurately or not — as co-production and co-dependence rather than exploitation or charity. The strategy emphasizes infrastructure connectivity, logistics management, digital infrastructure, smart cities, industrial parks, manufacturing cooperation, and export support. These projects create domestic constituencies: jobs, contracts, port throughput, wages, and broad political winners in the region. Financial cooperation sweetens the model further through local-currency settlement, RMB clearing arrangements, credit and debt swap lines, and even Panda bonds on offer. The aim is straightforward: reduce exposure to U.S. financial leverage, political pressure points, and sanctions risk over time.\n\nTrump's [push for U.S. oil companies to invest](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/what-the-big-oil-executives-told-trump-about-investing-in-venezuela.html) in Venezuela offered a series of security guarantees but surfaced a familiar constraint: executives emphasized that investment also hinges on long-term financing, risk-sharing, and enforceable contracts — support China routinely provides its firms through policy banks and export credits — while Washington has yet to signal a clear willingness to deploy comparable tools via the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation(DFC), Ex-Im Bank, or multilateral finance.\n\nAnd those financial support and assistance tools should not be pursued in a vacuum; when done well, they are designed to anchor influence in physical strategic assets — natural resources, ports, logistics hubs, energy infrastructure, and transit corridors — where economics and geopolitics inevitably intersect.\n\n### $500 billion in trade, Panama Canal confrontation\n\nScale matters. China-Latin America trade exceeded $500 billion in 2024, and the region represents more than 670 million consumers, many of whom are drawn to Chinese products on price, availability, and increasingly quality. These are not marginal markets. They are structural to China's global growth model and export strategy.\n\nBeijing is also candid — if selectively so — about its interest in strategic resources. Energy and critical minerals feature prominently, alongside language about long-term supply arrangements and local-currency pricing. Access spans the value chain from extraction to utilization. For U.S. policymakers, investors, and CEOs, this is the commercial backbone the NSS must contend with. This is not about nostalgia for the Monroe Doctrine; it is a 21st-century strategy designed to achieve many of the same outcomes through more modern means and more seductive rhetoric.\n\nThe Panama Canal brings these strategies into direct collision. China's policy paper treats ports, logistics, and maritime cooperation as first-order instruments of development and influence — and, in a crisis, as latent strategic assets to be exploited during a military confrontation with the regional hegemon (the U.S.). The NSS, meanwhile, explicitly flags \"key strategic locations\" and acknowledges how commercial infrastructure can be repurposed for military use. Panama — more than Venezuela — is where these approaches collide most sharply. [Ongoing debates over port concessions and terminal control](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/22/tanker-seizures-venezuela-oil-china.html) underscore that both Washington and Beijing view the canal itself and canal-adjacent assets as strategic, not merely commercial in nature.\n\nCrew members of Chinese Cosco Shipping Rose container ship wave Chinese and Panamenian flag before China's President Xi Jinping and Panama's Juan Carlso Varela, arrive at the Cocoli locks in the expanded Panama Canal, in Panama City, Panama on December 3, 2018.\n\nLuis Acosta | Afp | Getty Images\n\nSo, does U.S. action in Venezuela change the calculus? In the long run, no.\n\nIt will raise risk premiums for many — for Chinese firms, regional leaders, and global companies caught between compliance regimes, complicate logistics and supply chains, and further the weaponization of market access. It will push some governments to hedge more carefully, demand higher \"insurance\" from Beijing, or seek stronger economic and security assurances from Washington. But it does not erase the fundamentals of what China has spent two decades building: trade corridors, lending relationships, political networks, and now an explicit push into high-tech cooperation — from EVs, AI, and satellites to aerospace and digital trade, and aligning closely with where many Latin American economies want to go.\n\nZoom out one level further and the logic extends north. Greenland and the Arctic are not separate conversations; they are the same set of arguments, just on ice. Washington frames Greenland through minerals, shipping lanes, and military access. Beijing frames the Arctic as an international space with global stakes, governed by international law, where non-Arctic states have legitimate interests. If the U.S. believes spheres can be secured through doctrine plus decisive action, China's operating assumption is the opposite. It believes in focusing its pushback on arguments that the U.S. has used for decades to justify their presence in the Asia-Pacific region — that states have a right to the global commons, that big states have global interests that must be protected, and that a long-term and well establish persistent presence in a region must be respected. China takes these same positions with respect to Latin America and Greenland.\n\nThe action in Venezuela does show that the Trump administration is more serious than its predecessors about reasserting hemispheric dominance — and that the NSS is not merely rhetorical. But China will not be rushing for the exits in the Western Hemisphere. It is deeply entrenched. Smaller powers have agency too. They will not be dictated to without far richer incentives, protections, or more sustained pressure than a single special forces operation can provide.\n\nIf Washington wants a hemisphere that chooses the United States rather than submits to it, it must compete with China's full-stack approach: finance, infrastructure, technology, people-to-people exchange, affordable products, political access, and a compelling narrative of partnership. A declaration in an NSS and one dramatic operation are short-term events. China's engagement in Latin America is a long game, and the competition it sets in motion will be neither quick nor simple.\n\n—*By* [*Dewardric McNeal*](https://www.cnbc.com/dewardric-mcneal/)*, Managing Director and Senior Policy Analyst at Longview Global, and a CNBC Contributor*\n\n## [More In The Bottom Line](https://www.cnbc.com/global-cfo-council/)\n\n[The crypto ATM's days in America may be numbered](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/bitcoin-crypto-atm-scam-fraud-regulation.html)\n\n[Kevin Williams](https://www.cnbc.com/kevin-williams/)\n\n[Op-ed: China won the 2025 battle in Trump's trade war.

Global growth was probably about 3% in 2025, far higher than gloomy forecasts made in the spring and summer. That matches the pattern of the decade.

It slowed under Donald Trump, after accounting for the mechanical impact of lower immigration, but only a little.

Now global interest rates have fallen and, in America, China and Germany, fiscal stimulus is supporting growth.\n\n### Explore more\n\n[Leaders](/topics/leaders)[Opinion](/topics/opinion)[Economics](/topics/economics)[Protectionism](/topics/protectionism)\n\nThis article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline “Manufacturing’s malaise”\n\n### From the January 10th 2026 edition\n\nDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents\n\n[⇒Explore the edition](/weeklyedition/2026-01-10)\n\n---\n\n[Reuse this content](https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&publication=economist&title=Do%20not%20mistake%20a%20resilient%20global%20economy%20for%20populist%20success&publicationDate=2026-01-08&contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fqqarfvvk2rf5ebjdpmi3uftkhrt178m9&type=A&orderBeanReset=TRUE)\n\n---\n\n## [More from Leaders](/leaders)\n\n### [France is paralysed, and everyone is to blame](/leaders/2026/01/08/france-is-paralysed-and-everyone-is-to-blame)\n\nThe budgetary impasse is just one symptom of collective political uselessness\n\n### [AI is transforming the pharma industry for the better](/leaders/2026/01/08/ai-is-transforming-the-pharma-industry-for-the-better)\n\nIt is changing the way drugs are discovered and tested\n\n---\n\n### [Does Japan have a “foreigner problem”?](/leaders/2026/01/08/does-japan-have-a-foreigner-problem)\n\nYes—but it is not what populist politicians say it is\n\n---\n\n### [In Donald Trump’s world, the strong take what they can](/leaders/2026/01/08/in-donald-trumps-world-the-strong-take-what-they-can)\n\nThat will be bad for America—and everyone else\n\n### [Britain and the EU should be bolder in getting closer](/leaders/2025/12/30/britain-and-the-eu-should-be-bolder-in-getting-closer)\n\nHow post-Brexit Britain should approach relations with its nearest and biggest market\n\n### [The future of space exploration depends on better biology](/leaders/2025/12/30/the-future-of-space-exploration-depends-on-better-biology)\n\nRockets are great, but sewage treatment is what you need for the long haul\n\n---\n\n---\n\n ",

The Trade Management Market focuses on software and services that help organizations efficiently manage international trade operations, including compliance, documentation, customs filing, and tariff management. It supports businesses in navigating complex global trade regulations, reducing operational risks, and improving supply chain visibility.\n\n**Download PDF Brochure@**[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=70680100](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=70680100&utm_campaign=trademanagementmarket&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=referral)\n\n**Large Enterprises segment to have the highest market share during the forecast period**\n\nComplex trade operations are handled by large businesses in industries like consumer goods and retail, healthcare, aerospace and defence, and transportation and logistics. These businesses have a very robust and extensive network of regionally dispersed suppliers and partners. Large businesses handle the import and export of high-value items to and from many nations. Large firms are important players in the trade management market because they manage the extensive network and adhere to the rules to avoid harsh penalties.\n\n**Transportation and Logistics is expected have the highest market share during the forecast period**\n\nThe transportation and logistics industry has benefited greatly from rising globalisation. As new technologies streamline its basic processes, the transportation and logistics sector is undergoing a digital transition. The transportation and logistics sectors are under pressure to reduce operational costs and streamline trade procedures as a result of the expansion of global trade. Trade management tools give transportation and logistics organisations the visibility they need to oversee shipments and inventories and deliver dependable services.\n\n**North America region to record the highest market share in the trade management market**\n\nDuring the projected period, North America is anticipated to hold the biggest market share for trade management. North America, which is regarded as one of the most developed regions in terms of technology adoption and infrastructure, makes up the majority of GTM solutions and services. Another critical element supporting the expansion of the trade management sector is a robust infrastructure supporting international trade in this area. The expansion of the trade management market in North America is projected to be supported by significant investments in the aerospace and defence, healthcare, and life sciences sectors.\n\n**Request Sample Pages@**[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=70680100](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=70680100&utm_campaign=trademanagementmarket&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=referral)\n\n**Unique Features in the Trade Management Market**\n\nTrade management platforms come with built-in compliance engines that automatically update and enforce global trade regulations, tariff changes, sanctions lists, and restricted party screening. This reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and protects businesses from costly fines and shipment holds.\n\nOne of the standout features is real-time visibility into trade operations, including shipment tracking, customs clearance status, and documentation flow. This transparency enables quicker response to delays, exceptions, or disruptions across global supply chains.\n\nInnovative tools for tariff classification, duty drawback processing, free trade agreement (FTA) qualification, and duty optimization help companies reduce landed costs. These features empower users to strategically plan imports/exports and maximize cost savings.\n\nTrade management solutions uniquely offer centralized creation, validation, and storage of all trade documents—such as commercial invoices, packing lists, certificates of origin, and bills of lading—facilitating accuracy, audit readiness, and faster customs processing.\n\n**Major Highlights of the Trade Management Market**\n\nThe trade management market has seen significant expansion as global trade volumes increase and e-commerce continues to flourish. Businesses are investing in robust trade solutions to manage the complexities of international shipment flows, cross-border compliance, and multi-modal logistics more efficiently.\n\nA major highlight is the strong adoption of cloud-native trade management systems that offer scalability, real-time data access, and seamless integration with ERP, TMS, and customs systems. These platforms enable better collaboration, faster deployment, and lower IT overhead.\n\nWith constantly evolving trade regulations, companies are prioritizing advanced compliance automation, tariff management, and restricted party screening. This emphasis helps avoid fines, shipment delays, and reputational risk while maintaining smoother customs clearance.\n\nModern trade management solutions are incorporating analytics and AI-driven insights to provide predictive risk assessments, landed cost optimization, and performance benchmarking. These capabilities empower businesses to make strategic decisions that can reduce costs and improve operational efficiency.\n\n**Inquire Before Buying@**[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry\\_Before\\_BuyingNew.asp?id=70680100](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=70680100&utm_campaign=trademanagementmarket&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=referral)\n\n**Top Companies in the Trade Management Market**\n\nKey and innovative vendors in the trade management market are Oracle (US), Infor (US), Thomson Reuters (US), Livingston International (Canada), Aptean (US), SAP (Germany), Noatum Logistics (Spain), E2open (US), Descartes (Canada), CargoWise (Australia), Expeditors (US), BDP International (US), Accuity (US), QAD Precision (US), 3rdwave (Canada), AEB (Germany), Shipsy (India), Bamboo Rose (US), Bolero International (UK), MIC Customs Solutions (UK), OCR Services (US), Webb Fontaine (UAE), Neurored (Spain), 4PL Consultancy (UK), Global Custom Compliance (China), Vigilant Global Trade Services (US), and Centrade (US).\n\nOracle offers goods and services that cover all facets of business IT, including platforms, applications, and infrastructures.

It’s a legacy of what once felt like a perpetual age of corporate expansionism that defined America’s optimistic and ubiquitous place in the world as a source of capital and jobs.\n\nThese days, Ford’s Cologne outpost is a faltering emblem.

But even as many of the arguments shifted, one remained central: the notion that tariffs will inspire a revival in American manufacturing.

The dollar is coming off its worst annual performance since 2017, with analysts predicting another year of decline.\n\n\"The U.S. economy still looks pretty good. A lot of the positioning in short U.S. dollar has already been done, and I think that's going to prevent the dollar from getting significantly weaker going forward,\" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis.\n\n\"I think the winners could be some emerging market currencies more than the euro or the yen,” he added.\n\nTraders are pricing in at least two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year, although a divided central bank indicated in December there would be only one cut in 2026. The Fed is expected to keep rates steady at its meeting this month.\n\nMarkets have kept geopolitical concerns in the background, focusing on economic data instead.\n\nHowever, risks that President Donald Trump's administration could be forced to refund more than to importers if the U.S. Supreme Court this week declares his duties unlawful could resurface to hurt the dollar.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday the 2027 U.S. military budget should be $1.5 trillion, stoking some concerns about rising debt and a [higher risk premium](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-dip-defense-firms-climb-up-trump-budget-plans-2026-01-08/) on U.S. assets.\n\n## EURO ZONE DATA AND GREENLAND IN FOCUS\n\nOn the euro front, recent inflation figures drove the currency lower and German Bund yields to a one-month low.\n\nThe euro was down 0.05% at $1.1669 on Thursday, after dropping by 0.45% in the last two sessions.\n\n“Soft European inflation reinforces dovish sentiment, while the Greenland crisis underscores Europe’s relative vulnerability, potentially triggering further euro selling,” said Olivier Korber, foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Trump retained the option to address his objective to take over [Greenland by military means](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-move-greenland-2026-01-07/), while alarmed allies, including France and Germany, were working on a response.\n\nAnalysts flagged that the debate about changes in the European Central Bank policy shifted towards the possibility of a rate hike a year from now, while inflation is currently getting back to target with core edging lower.\n\nThe Japanese yen was roughly unchanged at 156.70 per U.S. dollar.\n\n\"For those hoping for a significant appreciation of the yen, the only option for now is to wait for the conflict with China to cool down again,\" said Michael Pfister, foreign exchange strategist at Commerzbank.\n\n“The Chinese government could further escalate the conflict with a complete export ban on rare earths, which would deal a significant blow to the yen,” he added.\n\n[Shares in Japanese chemical manufacturers fell](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-chemical-makers-fall-after-china-anti-dumping-probe-announcement-2026-01-08/) on Thursday while those of their Chinese rivals jumped after China said it was launching an anti-dumping probe into imports of chemicals used in chipmaking.\n\nThe Australian dollar eased to $0.6704, just below the 15-month high it touched earlier this week.\n\nReporting by Stefano Rebaudo and Sophie Kiderlin;

Any resemblances to actual future events are purely coincidental. This scenario is plausible, but certainly not inevitable. It is offered in the modest hope that it will inspire and inform efforts to prevent the disastrous outcome described here.\n\nIt is January 2028. Looking back, the Americans did not “take” Greenland—not in any concrete sense. There was no invasion, no purchase, not even a plebiscite. But in the shadowy corridors of Arctic politics, Washington moved deliberately to confound its opponents. The Americanization of Greenland transcended brute imperial force in the Russian mold.\n\nTwo years earlier, in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s showy military ouster of Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro—and Trump’s insistence that he intended to take over Greenland next—foreign policy analysts had been scrambling to imagine how he might seize the island. Would he force Denmark to sell its semiautonomous territory? Send in the troops, effectively attacking a NATO ally? But Trump didn’t have to do either. Instead, his administration pioneered a new form of twenty-first-century imperialism in which sovereignty over territory is imposed less by force than by function, through investments, contractors, and legal ambiguities. In the process, Trump’s Greenland gambit rewrote the rules of international order and created a template that Beijing, Moscow, and others soon followed. Now known as “geo-osmosis,” what follows is the story of how it happened.\n\n### **FROM TROLLING TO TRUTH**\n\nTrump originally floated the idea of acquiring Greenland in his first term. The 2019 revelation that he had inquired about purchasing the territory from Denmark was met with global bemusement and a curt “Greenland is not for sale” response from the Danish and Greenlandic governments. Few in Brussels, Copenhagen, or Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, took the threat seriously. After all, Trump had long trafficked in hyperbolic bombast.\n\nSeasoned Trump observers noted, however, that the idea of territorial acquisition had long held a special place in Trump’s worldview. Greenland grabbed Trump’s attention as “essentially, a big real estate deal,” as he put it, an accomplishment that the journalists Peter Baker and Susan Glasser note in a 2022 book “might give him a place in American history like William Seward’s purchase of Alaska from Russia.”\n\nEarly in his second term, Trump revived the proposal and gave it a geopolitical rationale. His argument that the United States should control Greenland had three pillars: It would help the country secure critical resources—the island is estimated to have enormous oil and gas reserves as well as troves of rare-earth minerals such as cobalt, graphite, and lithium. It would expand the U.S. military’s reach in the Arctic. And it would limit Chinese and Russian influence in a territory key to U.S. national security.\n\nBut when Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen offered to give the U.S. president more or less anything he wanted short of sovereignty to achieve those goals, Trump simply refused. It became clear that he was not actually interested in Arctic security. Rather, Greenland became the first in a series of Trumpian territorial ambitions that included Canada, the Panama Canal, and even the Gaza Strip—acquisitions that he apparently believed might secure his place on Mount Rushmore.\n\nAs was so often the case with Trump, it was difficult to separate the trolling from the truth. But it soon emerged that Greenland was a genuine target. With a more loyal second-term team ready to carry out his whims and a supine Congress, his administration was able to create a plan to make his desire a reality.\n\n### **ABSORB AND CONQUER**\n\nIn Greenland, the Trump administration lifted a few elements from its Venezuela template: for instance, the administration directed U.S. spy agencies to step up efforts to identify people in Greenland and Denmark who could support their objectives for the island, just as it leaned on the CIA to help overthrow Maduro. But Trump’s apparatchiks quickly concluded that the best way to control Greenland was not to follow the Venezuela model or to buy Greenland. Regardless of its immediate success, overt military action against a NATO ally would only ignite local and global opposition and limit the United States’ ability to assert sovereignty over the island. But they could control it by cleverly exploiting its supply dependencies.\n\nThe administration understood that Greenland was economically and politically fragile. At 56,000 people, its population was 500 times smaller than Venezuela’s. Manhattan’s East Village had more residents. A mostly uninhabitable ice sheet a quarter of the size of the U.S. mainland, its people were scattered and its infrastructure spotty; with only 93 miles of roads, many Greenlandic communities could reach the others only by boat, small plane, snowmobile, or dogsled, and less than 70 percent of the population used the Internet. Greenlanders had long resented Danish rule and accused the Danish government of keeping them poor and dependent. The island’s semiautonomous government, limited budgetary sovereignty, and simmering independence movement—most Greenlandic political parties ostensibly wanted the territory to gain full autonomy—made it highly susceptible to external influence. Add to this a thin institutional infrastructure and a lack of indigenous wealth, and you had an ideal laboratory for what Trump officials at the time termed “motivated alignment.”\n\nA planning cell in the White House began drafting what was euphemistically titled the Northern Strategic Realignment Initiative. With information from U.S. spy agencies in hand, in May 2026, the Trump administration announced a $10 billion “strategic development initiative” for Greenland, ostensibly to upgrade infrastructure and promote the exploitation of the island’s natural resources.\n\n> The Americans did not need the Greenlandic population’s consent.\n\nWashington moved through proxies. A patchwork of development consortiums, disaster response teams, nongovernmental organizations, consultants, and Arctic energy forums, almost all boasting loose ties to Trump-aligned donors or U.S. government funding, descended on Greenland in the summer of 2026. The activities of these polite people were ostensibly civilian: installing broadband, training local officials, or building roads, small airports, and health centers. Investment was deployed not nationally but municipally. Coastal communities received critical supplies, construction contracts, and digital infrastructure grants. The money came with no overt political strings, but it did have an accompanying series of technical agreements and memorandums that quietly shifted local loyalties and forced budgetary dependence.\n\nThis flurry of help and investment did not fool most Greenlanders. As early as January 2025, a survey jointly commissioned by Danish and Greenlandic newspapers showed that over 85 percent of the island’s residents opposed Greenland’s incorporation into the United States, and those numbers never changed very much. Greenlanders feared the erosion of their culture and autonomy, not to mention having to navigate the nightmare of the U.S. health-care system. But some of Greenland’s government officials and community leaders, long frustrated by Copenhagen’s paternalism and budget constraints, found themselves tempted by these American offers.\n\nThus, the U.S. efforts set the terms of Greenland’s next political phase. The Americans funded local media. They offered fellowships to emerging political leaders. Washington pushed a framing of Greenlandic identity in opposition to Danish “colonialism”—and as compatible with U.S. patronage. Ultimately, the Americans did not need the population’s consent. They just needed a few collaborators amid a general sense of fatigue and cynicism with politics as usual—an attitude Trump’s team is skilled at seeding.\n\n### **FEALTY FOLLOWS FUNCTION**\n\nThe sovereignty campaign was therefore not one of persuasion. It was one of circumvention and absorption. Trump’s advisers understood that Greenland’s democratic mechanisms could be rerouted by fragmenting the elite, creating greater economic dependence, and generating a need for emergency governance. Danish resupply routes began to face delays as ships were stopped and searched at sea. Fuel shortages, medical supply bottlenecks, and bureaucratic “miscommunications” caused by unexplained electricity and Internet outages pushed municipalities toward the only actors offering an alternative: the Americans.\n\nAround 150 U.S. service members had already been stationed at Pituffik Space Base in northern Greenland. But acting on humanitarian grounds, the U.S. military rapidly expanded its footprint. Emergency logistics hubs became new de facto bases. U.S. contractors took over local security training. By October, several Greenlandic lawmakers had formed a “Sovereign Future Caucus,” signaling their openness to “alternative security and economic partnerships.” One Trump adviser described it as “the Taiwan model in reverse: build deep ties first and let the sovereignty claims follow.”\n\nBy early 2027, Greenland was operating in a sovereignty twilight. Formally, it was still part of the Danish realm, but it had become functionally dependent on a U.S. presidential administration that had not even bothered to try to secure Greenlandic popular support.\n\n> Greenland’s democratic mechanisms could be rerouted.\n\nTo move from de facto integration toward de jure sovereignty, the U.S. Justice Department assembled a legal framework that invoked historical precedent. Drawing on the 1917 U.S. purchase of the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands), and citing Greenland’s right to self-determination under the UN Charter, Trump administration lawyers constructed what they called a sovereignty transition plan.\n\nThe Trump team avoided a national referendum, knowing it would fail. Instead, the administration encouraged the Greenlandic parliament to adopt a declaration of “provisional autonomy” and offered Washington’s recognition of Greenlandic sovereignty in principle. It was a phrase loaded with possibilities and devoid of obligations. A letter of support from pro-American Greenlandic officials, signed in July 2027, set the plan in motion. The U.S. then formally beganstationing U.S. security forces in Nuuk, using the letter to claim that they had been invited by the Greenlandic parliament, even though no vote had been held.\n\nIn October 2027, Greenland’s parliament declared provisional autonomy and an “interim sovereignty transition.” The United States raised its flag over new “civil-military liaison offices” in Nuuk and Greenland’s three next-largest towns. Negotiations to grant Greenland a compact of free association, akin to those the United States has with Micronesia or the Marshall Islands, began immediately afterward.\n\n### **EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN**\n\nThese efforts, of course, ignited a firestorm in Denmark. The Danish government declared the sovereignty transition plan a “hostile act” and withdrew its ambassador from Washington. The European Union denounced it as a violation of international law. The French president called it “a colonial anachronism wrapped in nationalist theatrics.” But Denmark had little military or economic leverage to wield. And the EU, more focused on managing other elements of its strained relationship with the United States, was unwilling to do anything beyond “monitoring the situation.”\n\nMeanwhile, Russian bombers conducted patrols near Greenlandic airspace. Chinese state media outlets declared the United States a “rogue imperialist actor,” even as many of their diplomats took notes. But these efforts only strengthened Trump’s case that the United States needed to control Greenland to protect it—and shore up U.S. national security.\n\nThe Greenland gambit divided American public opinion: MAGA conservatives hailed Trump’s move as a “strategic masterstroke,” while critics likened it to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and warned that the United States’ global credibility had suffered irreparably. But the administration’s media machine lurched into action, launching a public relations campaign called “America’s Frozen Frontier,” and Fox News aired segments with AI-generated images of Greenlandic children waving U.S. flags. Maps were redrawn. Trump rallies in Michigan and Pennsylvania featured chants of “Make Greenland Great Again.” The Trump Organization announced plans to make the island the “biggest, most beautiful winter resort” in human history, with fjord-based heli-skiing and extensive glamping opportunities.\n\nDenmark challenged the United States’ moves at the International Court of Justice, but the case languished in procedural purgatory, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed it as “nonsense.” Indigenous Greenlandic voices remained split: although some elites embraced U.S. investments, most residents warned of coming environmental degradation and cultural erasure. None of that mattered. U.S. contractors continued to deliver services. Washington concluded its association compact with Nuuk, assumed full authority over Greenland’s defense and security affairs, and asserted a claim that Greenland represented a U.S. “special economic zone.” Trump declared victory.\n\n### **THE COLD BENEATH THE ICE**\n\nDecades later, the Greenland gambit would be studied as the prototype for a new form of state expansion, one that blurs the lines between consent, coercion, and capitulation. The Trump administration showed that territory need not be seized when it can be absorbed. It affirmed a simple truth of twenty-first-century geopolitics: in the absence of coherent international resistance, norms matter little; facts on the ground suffice. Commentators drew a direct line from the Trump team’s effort in Greenland to the later Russian absorption of Georgia and, of course, the Chinese takeover of Taiwan.\n\nIt also redefined the nature of international order and sovereignty. Manufactured dependence was no longer considered a form of imperialism; they became a method for building fraternal ties. Indigenous populations no longer determined sovereignty; supply chains did. And, perhaps most tellingly, the unimaginable became more than just possible. It became marketable.\n\nLoading...\n\n### You are reading a free article\n\nSubscribe to *Foreign Affairs* to get unlimited access.\n\n* Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n* Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n* Unlock access to the *Foreign Affairs* app for reading on the go\n\nAlready a subscriber?

We are a democratic country.\"\n\nTrump, who said the U.S. was taking temporary control of oil-producing Venezuela, has said repeatedly he wants to take over Greenland and told [The Atlantic](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-warns-venezuelan-vp-delcy-rodrguez-magazine-interview-2026-01-04/) magazine on Sunday: \"We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early on Monday, Trump said he would revisit the topic in a few weeks.\n\nIn a Facebook post late on Sunday, Nielsen said: \"Enough is enough... No more fantasies about annexation.\"\n\nDenmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also addressed Trump's comments: \"Unfortunately, I think the American president should be taken seriously when he says he wants Greenland,\" she told public broadcaster DR. \"I have made it very clear where the Kingdom of Denmark stands, and Greenland has repeatedly said that it does not want to be part of the United States.\"\n\nItem 1 of 2 Danish troops practice looking for potential threats during a military drill as Danish, Swedish and Norwegian home guard units together with Danish, German and French troops take part in joint military drills in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, September 17, 2025.

It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" Trump told reporters [aboard Air Force One](https://youtu.be/9XVjd3R2T3g?si=x2TZQwO1Y0tBR0hB&t=1465).\n\nIn an [email to Chinese state media Xinhua](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/9KPVg29SLc3qYMjs8f73LQ) News Agency, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump views acquiring Greenland as a national security priority to deter rivals in the Arctic. She added that his team is weighing a range of options — including the possibility of using military force.\n\nChinese authorities have [pushed back](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202601/t20260105_11806736.html). On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized Washington for \"using the so-called 'China threat' as a pretext for itself to seek selfish gains.\"\n\n## Frozen frontiers\n\nChina described itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in its [2018 official Arctic Policy](https://english.www.gov.cn/archive/white_paper/2018/01/26/content_281476026660336.htm), asserting its right to use resources and develop shipping routes in the Arctic.\n\nState-linked Chinese firms have also invested heavily in Arctic energy projects and developed maritime routes that could reduce shipping times between Asia and Europe.\n\n\"China would push back hard against any U.S. move to take control of Greenland, given Beijing's commercial interests on the island — from resource exploration to the security of Arctic shipping routes,\" said Xinbo Wu, director at the Center for American Studies at Shanghai-based Fudan University.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department [has identified China and Russia as key competitors](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3855787/now-the-hard-part-implementing-arctic-strategy/) in the region, pointing to their expanded military capabilities and joint naval patrols as risks to national security.\n\nBeijing could seek to raise costs for Washington through multilateral diplomacy and may deepen military cooperation with Russia in the Arctic region to deter the U.S., Wu said.\n\n\"We are really getting into uncharted territory and we have to be extremely careful,\" said Henry Wang, founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization, a think-tank that often aligns with Beijing's thinking.\n\n\"The international community has to work together now and probably stop this kind of unilateral approach.\"\n\n## Energy, rare earths, infrastructure\n\nBeijing's main interests in Greenland mirror those of the U.S.: [rare earths](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/greenland-rare-earths-us-china-processing-reality-mining-arctic-shipping-lanes-route-critical-minerals.html), uranium and zinc, said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group.\n\nGreenland, a vast and sparsely populated autonomous Danish territory, hosts several large rare-earth element deposits, with some discovered mines ranking [among the world's largest](https://eng.geus.dk/media/13174/go29.pdf). These minerals are crucial for high-tech industries, from electric vehicles to defense equipment.\n\nBesides the U.S. and China, the [European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6166) has also tried to secure access to these critical mineral supplies.\n\nChinese investors have grown \"much more cautious\" about Greenland in recent years amid rising geopolitical uncertainty, said Patrik Andersson, an analyst at the Swedish National China Center at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs.\n\nDenmark retains the legal authority to block foreign investments on national security grounds.\n\nIn 2016, a Hong Kong-linked firm attempted to acquire a former Danish naval base and related port facilities, prompting Copenhagen to block the sale. A Chinese state-owned firm also withdrew its bid for an airport construction contract worth 3.6 billion Danish kroner ($563 million) in 2019 after Greenland chose Denmark over Beijing to finance the project.\n\nAndersson noted that in some cases, Chinese interest in Greenland's minerals appeared to have already declined before the recent rise in geopolitical risk, in part due to the high costs of operating in Greenland.\n\n\"From a commercial standpoint, Chinese investors may see more attractive opportunities elsewhere,\" he added.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO6:3606:36\n\nTrump's Greenland ambitions are a wake up call: Chinese think tank\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nSome Chinese-backed projects in Greenland have also stalled over environmental concerns.\n\nChinese state-affiliated company [Shenghe Resources](/quotes/392-SZ/) acquired a stake in [the Kvanefjeld project in south](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2020/presence-before-power/4-greenland-what-is-china-doing-there-and-why/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20Kvanefjeld,Kvanefjeld%20site.%EF%BB%BF%5B75%5D)[ern Greenland in 2016](https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20161031/pdf/43ch5gzhvhrmhq.pdf). The project, which was set to become one of the world's largest rare-earth and uranium mines, was halted after Greenland [reinstated a ban](https://archive.is/3cbEl) on uranium mining in 2021.\n\nWhile some analysts have estimated Chinese investments in the Arctic at over $90 billion and described them as \"unconstrained,\" Harvard University's Kennedy School said the figures are \"highly exaggerated\" because they included failed investments and unbuilt projects.\n\nAccording to [Harvard's estimates](https://www.belfercenter.org/research-analysis/china-arctic-investments) in June 2025, most of the mineral, oil and gas resource projects in Greenland with Chinese backing had been paused or canceled.\n\nDespite those setbacks, Greenland [opened its representation office in Beijing in 2023](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-10-28/VHJhbnNjcmlwdDc1NTc3/index.html) as the Arctic country sought to deepen ties with Beijing.\n\n## 'Polar Silk Road'\n\nChina has eyes on new shipping routes opening up as melting ice opens shorter paths between Asia and Europe. China's exports to the European Union, its second-largest trading bloc, [grew 8.1% year-on-year](http://www.customs.gov.cn/customs/2025-12/08/article_2025122717403341061.html) in the first eleven months of 2025.\n\nBeijing formally introduced the \"Polar Silk Road\" in its 2018 Arctic policy white paper and launched its [first Arctic shipping route to Europe](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202509/1344211.shtml) in September 2025, cutting transit times to about 20 days, roughly half the time needed for a journey through [the Suez Canal](https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/p/0P9505FV.html).\n\nThe alternative sea route presents not only \"immense economic opportunities\" for Beijing through faster trade and access to untapped natural resources, but also a \"strategic challenge to the United States' dominance of global sea lanes,\" said Zoha Fatima, a researcher focused on Arctic governance and geopolitics.\n\nChina has also expanded Arctic research efforts over the years, supporting discoveries related to sea ice composition, space weather and marine life.\n\nBuilding on existing projects in Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland, China has also [planned a research](https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/online-analysis/2020/02/china-arctic/) and satellite ground station in Greenland.\n\nThese facilities are crucial for China's Beidou navigation satellite system, developed as an alternative to the U.S.'s GPS system.\n\nChina's polar research programs have raised security concerns in the Arctic. In 2022, the Biden administration [asserted that](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/National-Strategy-for-the-Arctic-Region.pdf) China used its scientific engagements to conduct \"dual-use research with intelligence or military applications.\"\n\n\"If Trump were to take Greenland, Beijing would frame this as U.S. unilateralism and North Atlantic militarization, while stressing respect for Danish-Greenlandic autonomy and UN-based rules,\" said Eurasia's Wang.\n\n*— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng, Emily Tan contributed to this story.*",

But the crisis has exposed an uncomfortable reality - Denmark is [rallying support](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-move-greenland-2026-01-07/) to protect a territory whose population wants independence, and whose largest opposition party now wants to bypass Copenhagen and [negotiate directly with Washington](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-should-hold-talks-with-us-without-denmark-opposition-leader-says-2026-01-08/).\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fdenmarks-greenland-dilemma-defending-territory-already-its-way-out-2026-01-10%2F)\n\n\"Denmark risks exhausting its foreign policy capital to secure Greenland, only to watch it walk away afterwards,\" said Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen, a political science professor at University of Copenhagen.\n\n## STRATEGIC RELEVANCE\n\nDenmark cannot let Greenland go without losing its [geopolitical relevance](https://www.reuters.com/world/why-does-trump-want-greenland-could-he-get-it-2025-01-08/) in the [Arctic territory](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GREENLAND-ELECTION/MAPS/zjvqaeledvx/), strategically located between Europe and North America and a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system.\n\nYet it may ultimately have nothing to show for its efforts if [Greenlanders choose independence](https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland/) - or strike their own deal with Washington.\n\nThe stakes extend beyond Denmark's national interests. European allies have rallied behind Denmark not just out of solidarity, but because giving up Greenland would set a dangerous precedent that could embolden other powers to pursue territorial claims against smaller nations, upending the post-1945 world order.\n\nDenmark's foreign ministry declined to comment, but referred to joint remarks by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on December 22.\n\n\"National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,\" the two leaders said. \"They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country ... Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.\"\n\nThis week, Frederiksen said: \"If the U.S. chooses to attack another NATO country, everything stops, including NATO and the security the alliance has provided since World War Two.\"\n\n## THE 'GREENLAND CARD'\n\nFor now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table, including buying the territory or taking it by force.\n\nCopenhagen professor Rasmussen said any discussion of whether holding on to Greenland is worth the cost has been drowned out by outrage at Trump's threats.\n\n\"It is not part of the political debate in Denmark. I fear we have gone into patriotic overdrive,\" he said.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Greenland's strategic location gave Denmark outsized influence in Washington and allowed it to maintain lower defence spending than would otherwise be expected of a NATO ally.\n\nThis became known as \"the Greenland Card\", according to a 2017 report by the University of Copenhagen's Centre for Military Studies.\n\nBut Greenland's aspirations for self-determination have been brewing since the former colony got greater autonomy and its own parliament in 1979. A 2009 agreement explicitly recognised Greenlanders' right to independence if they choose.\n\nAll Greenlandic parties say they want independence, but differ on how, and when, to achieve it.\n\nTrump's pressure has accelerated a timeline that was already in motion, forcing Copenhagen to spend political capital and financial resources on a relationship with an increasingly uncertain endpoint.\n\n\"How much should we fight for someone who doesn't really care about us?\" Joachim B. Olsen, a political commentator and former Danish lawmaker, told Reuters.\n\n## THE FINANCIAL BURDEN\n\nCopenhagen provides an annual block grant of roughly 4.3 billion Danish crowns ($610 million) to Greenland's economy, which is near stagnation with GDP growth of just 0.2% in 2025.\n\nThe central bank estimates an annual financing gap of approximately 800 million Danish crowns to make current public finances sustainable. Denmark also covers police, the justice system and defence - bringing total annual spending to just under $1 billion.\n\nIn addition, Copenhagen last year announced a 42 billion Danish crowns ($6.54 billion) [Arctic defence package](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/denmark-boost-arctic-defence-by-426-billion-greenland-government-says-2025-10-10/) in response to U.S. criticism that Denmark has not done enough to protect Greenland.\n\nSome reject framing the relationship in [transactional terms](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/can-us-put-price-tag-greenland-2026-01-09/), pointing to Denmark's legal and moral obligations under international law and centuries of shared history.\n\n\"We're talking about family relations, long history of relations between Denmark and Greenland,\" said Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. \"So this is much more, it's not just about defence and economy, it's about feelings, it's about culture.\"\n\n## DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT\n\nPrime Minister Frederiksen faces a difficult balancing act, said Serafima Andreeva, researcher at Oslo-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute.\n\nFor now, Denmark has little choice but to stand firm to maintain its diplomatic credibility, but in doing so risks the relationship with the United States at a time \"when Russia is an accelerating threat and being on the U.S.'s bad side is no good for anyone in the West\".\n\nFrederiksen also faces an election this year, though Greenland has not been a major theme.\n\n\"I don't understand why we have to cling to this community with Greenland when they so badly want out of it,\" Lone Frank, a Danish science writer and broadcaster, told Reuters. \"To be completely honest, Greenland doesn't inspire any sense of belonging in me.\"\n\nReporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen; additional reporting by Soren Sirich Jeppesen and Tom Little; Editing by Alex Richardson\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen](/authors/jacob-gronholt-pedersen/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nBased in Copenhagen, Jacob oversees reporting from Denmark, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

They rely on the extra interest income to offset losses when some cardholders default, making it harder to lend profitably to riskier customers.\n\n\"We estimate it would swing the business to unprofitable if enacted, with subprime credit cards hardest hit,\" Truist Securities wrote in a note.\n\nIn a joint statement, banking industry bodies said the move will hurt \"millions of American families and small business owners.\"\n\n## HOW WILL BANKS AND CONSUMER LENDERS BE IMPACTED?\n\nFor banks and consumer lenders, an interest-rate cap would cut into one of their most profitable lending businesses. Credit card interest rates can climb as high as 30%, compared with an average rate just above 6% on a 30-year fixed mortgage, according to Bankrate.\n\nA rate cap could wipe out billions of dollars in interest income for banks and card issuers, analysts say, forcing lenders to rethink the scale and pricing of their card businesses.\n\n\"If this were to be enacted, there will be material headwinds to card profitability and likely result in card issuers tightening credit boxes meaningfully, particularly to high-risk borrowers,\" analysts at Barclays said.\n\n## WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM A CAP ON CREDIT CARD INTEREST RATES?\n\nA tightening of credit in a heavily regulated banking sector could push some consumers, particularly subprime borrowers, toward buy-now, pay-later providers, pawn shops and even loan sharks.\n\n\"This rate cap would not address the root of the problem and could push consumers towards more expensive debt if the cap does not apply to other unsecured consumer products,\" J.P. Morgan analysts said.\n\n\"It could push more borrowing away from banks into other unsecured loans such as pawn shops and other non-bank consumer lenders.\"\n\nBorrowing from the less regulated parts of the credit market would increase risks for consumers already under financial strain.\n\nBuy-now, pay-later services, which typically earn money from merchants rather than charging interest to consumers, have surged in popularity in recent years, particularly among younger borrowers, and could benefit if banks rein in credit card lending.\n\nReporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Manya Saini](/authors/manya-saini/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nManya reports on prominent publicly listed U.S. financial firms, including Wall Street’s biggest banks, card companies, asset managers, and fintechs.

In Wednesday’s Truth Social post, Trump also claimed the income from tariffs would allow him to accomplish other promised goals—including paying down the national debt and issuing a dividend for what he called “moderate income Patriots within our Country.” The administration has repeatedly [floated the idea](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/11/16/bessent-says-2000-tariff-checks-need-approval-from-congress-after-trump-says-theyll-come-next-year/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/11/16/bessent-says-2000-tariff-checks-need-approval-from-congress-after-trump-says-theyll-come-next-year/\") of issuing $2,000 rebate checks to Americans using tariff income, but has not laid out specific plans as of January for delivering these payments. In December, Trump approved a $12 billion [aid package](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacharyfolk/2025/12/08/trump-planning-12-billion-aid-package-for-farmers-heres-what-we-know/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacharyfolk/2025/12/08/trump-planning-12-billion-aid-package-for-farmers-heres-what-we-know/\") for farmers, including soybean farmers previously hit hard by the tariff policy.

Production unwound amid the OPEC embargo and the nationalization of the country's oil industry under Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA).\n\nVolumes recovered in the late twentieth century before declining during the presidencies of Hugo Chávez and Nicolas Maduro, reaching a low of around 665,000 bpd in 2021 after the U.S. placed sanctions on PDVSA.\n\nToday's events to watch\n\n\\* U.S. initial jobless claims (8:30 AM EDT), trade deficit (8:30 AM EDT), Q3 productivity (8:30 AM EDT), consumer credit (3:00 PM EDT)\\* U.S. corporate earnings: Acuity Brands, Commercial Metals, Greenbrier Companies, Lindsay Corp, RPM International, TD Synnex\n\nWant to receive the Morning Bid in your inbox every weekday morning?

            "content": "Updated \n ET\n\n0952 ET – News that the U.S. will take up to 50 million barrels of sanctioned Venezuelan crude is pressuring WTI over Brent, as the heavy oil is seen ending up with U.S. Gulf coast refiners. “This isn’t increasing the supply of oil from Venezuela, simply redirecting it,” Simon Lack, portfolio manager of the Catalyst Energy Infrastructure Fund says in a note. “China, the biggest buyer, will need to replace those shipments. So it shouldn’t do much for oil prices although it does indicate the beginnings of a constructive dialogue on oil.” It may benefit U.S. refiners “who will receive more of the heavy crude they are set up for,” he adds. WTI is down 1.1% at $56.49 a barrel, and Brent if off 0.6% at $60.32.(anthony.harrup@wsj.com) [...] 1149 GMT – Oil prices recoup some losses but continue to trade lower, with focus on geopolitical developments in Venezuela and Ukraine. President Trump said Venezuela would turn over as much as 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the U.S. as he pushes for more control of the country’s oil sector. Meanwhile, the U.K. and France said they will set up military hubs across Ukraine if a cease-fire agreement with Russia is reached, offering some of the clearest details so far of the security guarantees Western allies will offer Kyiv. However, “while this is seen as a crucial step towards a peace agreement by Ukraine, it might turn out to be a no-go for Russia,” analysts at DNB say. Brent crude slips 0.3% to $60.51 a barrel, while WTI is down 0.6% to $56.81 a barrel.

So it shouldn’t do much for oil prices although it does indicate the beginnings of a constructive dialogue on oil.” It may benefit U.S. refiners “who will receive more of the heavy crude they are set up for,” he adds. WTI is down 1.1% at $56.49 a barrel, and Brent if off 0.6% at $60.32.([anthony.harrup@wsj.com](mailto:anthony.harrup@wsj.com))\n\n### Oil Slips as Traders Weigh Venezuela, Ukraine Developments\n\n1149 GMT – Oil prices recoup some losses but continue to trade lower, with focus on geopolitical developments in Venezuela and Ukraine. President Trump said Venezuela would turn over as much as 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the U.S. as he pushes for more control of the country’s oil sector. Meanwhile, the U.K. and France said they will set up military hubs across Ukraine if a cease-fire agreement with Russia is reached, offering some of the clearest details so far of the security guarantees Western allies will offer Kyiv. However, “while this is seen as a crucial step towards a peace agreement by Ukraine, it might turn out to be a no-go for Russia,” analysts at DNB say. Brent crude slips 0.3% to $60.51 a barrel, while WTI is down 0.6% to $56.81 a barrel. ([giulia.petroni@wsj.com](mailto:giulia.petroni@wsj.com))\n\nCopyright ©2026 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

If the U.S. were to lift sanctions on Venezuelan oil it could release barrels “and only add to the surplus that the market is already experiencing,” says Mizuho’s Robert Yawger. A substantial increase in Venezuelan production is widely expected to be a long-term prospect, although from around 1 million barrels a day at present “Venezuela could get to 1.5 million rather quickly,” Yawger says. “And I think Gulf coast refiners would be happy to take those barrels.” WTI settles down 2% at $57.13 a barrel, compared with $57.32 Friday. Brent falls 1.7% to $60.70 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com) [...] ### Crude Futures Ease Back From Early Gains\n\n1057 ET – Oil futures relinquish early gains with the market still weighing the implications of developments in Venezuela, while concerns about oversupply in 2026 remain. The ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro may have briefly camouflaged those concerns, but “I suspect the veil is going to be lifted again,” says Societe Generale’s Ben Hoff. “We’re going to have to face the hard reality that we are looking at a wall of crude heading onshore, something I think has been on people’s minds,” he adds. Crude’s move higher in the wake of the U.S. operation to remove Maduro was “more short-term market sentiment than anything fundamental,” he says.

If the U.S. were to lift sanctions on Venezuelan oil it could release barrels “and only add to the surplus that the market is already experiencing,” says Mizuho’s Robert Yawger. A substantial increase in Venezuelan production is widely expected to be a long-term prospect, although from around 1 million barrels a day at present “Venezuela could get to 1.5 million rather quickly,” Yawger says. “And I think Gulf coast refiners would be happy to take those barrels.” WTI settles down 2% at $57.13 a barrel, compared with $57.32 Friday. Brent falls 1.7% to $60.70 a barrel. ([anthony.harrup@wsj.com](mailto:anthony.harrup@wsj.com))\n\n### Crude Futures Ease Back From Early Gains\n\n1057 ET – Oil futures relinquish early gains with the market still weighing the implications of developments in Venezuela, while concerns about oversupply in 2026 remain. The ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro may have briefly camouflaged those concerns, but “I suspect the veil is going to be lifted again,” says Societe Generale’s Ben Hoff. “We’re going to have to face the hard reality that we are looking at a wall of crude heading onshore, something I think has been on people’s minds,” he adds. Crude’s move higher in the wake of the U.S. operation to remove Maduro was “more short-term market sentiment than anything fundamental,” he says. WTI is off 0.1% at $58.26 a barrel and Brent is near flat at $61.75.([anthony.harrup@wsj.com](mailto:anthony.harrup@wsj.com))\n\nCopyright ©2026 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The country’s energy infrastructure is in a dire state and tens of billions of investment will be needed to get things back up and running, Michael Brown of Pepperstone says in a note. “In any case, the extra-heavy sour nature of Venezuelan crude means the economics of extraction don’t really add up with Brent at $60 a barrel.” Any potential output increase “is a story for a much later date,” he says, and “nothing we’ve seen so far materially shifts the outlook for crude.” WTI and Brent are up 0.5% at $58.59 and $62.06 a barrel, respectively.

It's hard to do both - because lower profits mean oil companies drill less, not more.\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Fenergy%2Ftrump-pushes-drill-baby-drill-agenda-venezuela-hurts-producers-home-2026-01-09%2F)\n\nTrump has asked U.S. oil companies to fix Venezuela's oil industry and boost its production. In years gone by, access to Venezuela's vast onshore reserves - estimated to be the world's largest - would have been a once-in-a-generation opportunity.\n\nBut with oil markets well supplied, OPEC members sitting on spare capacity - and with abundant opportunities to pump oil more cheaply elsewhere - U.S. oil producer executives are facing the prospect of another hit to profits in the short term if more Venezuelan oil flows to the United States.\n\nOil prices in the U.S., the world's largest producer, are already below the $65 a barrel level many need to turn a profit, prompting mass layoffs, idled oilfield equipment and spending cuts.\n\nU.S. oil futures settled at $59.12 on Friday.\n\nU.S. oil executives, ranging from majors like Chevron and Exxon to lesser-known companies from Energy Secretary Chris Wright's home state of Colorado, were set to meet at the to discuss potential investment plans in Venezuela.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week said smaller, independent companies have expressed interest in developing the South American country's vast resources, and the U.S. government has floated the idea of subsidizing investments into the industry.\n\nThe [reality on the ground](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shale-rigs-idle-layoffs-rise-60-oil-tests-resilience-permian-2025-11-21/) for U.S. producers is stark, particularly as Trump moves Venezuelan barrels to the already well-supplied market.

Producers across the U.S. have watched the best drilling locations dry up and breakeven prices rise.\n\n\"$50 oil is really where production would start to fall,\" said Matthew Bernstein, Vice President, North America oil and gas at Rystad Energy.\n\nRystad sees onshore U.S. output, excluding Alaska, declining by around 150,000 bpd through 2026 in a $50 price environment.\n\nTechnological improvements have allowed drillers to eke out more oil at lower prices, but some analysts and industry participants have warned those improvements may be approaching their limit.\n\nThe OPEC+ producer group opted to pause production target increases for the first quarter of 2026, amid ample global supplies. OPEC could, however, start increasing output again as it seeks to take market share from U.S. shale producers.\n\nRedirecting Venezuelan barrels into the U.S. market is part of a broader effort to combat inflation by pressuring oil prices, Michael Alfaro, CIO of Gallo Partners, a regulatory - and policy-focused hedge fund said. While Trump is supportive of U.S. shale in principle, lower oil prices combined with steel tariffs, are two persistent headwinds for this group, he added.\n\n\"I’m very much in a wait-and-see mode because there are still big unanswered questions,\" said Mike Oestmann, CEO of shale producer Tall City Exploration in the Permian Basin.\n\nReporting by Georgina McCartney and Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; Editing by Liz Hampton, Simon Webb and Diane Craft\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Arathy Somasekhar](/authors/arathy-somasekhar/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nHouston-based energy reporter focused on oil markets and energy companies.

Trump has said he wants interim President Delcy Rodriguez to give the U.S. and private companies \"total access\" to Venezuela's oil industry.\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Fenergy%2Fvenezuela-us-talks-export-venezuelan-oil-us-sources-say-2026-01-06%2F)\n\nVenezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to a blockade on exports imposed by Trump since mid-December.\n\nThe blockade was part of rising U.S. pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that culminated in U.S. forces capturing him this weekend. Top Venezuelan officials have called Maduro's capture a kidnapping and accused the U.S. of trying to steal the country's vast oil reserves.\n\nA potential deal to sell the trapped crude to the U.S. could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources said.

Sanctions mean the company is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in U.S. dollars.\n\nRodriguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday, is herself under U.S. sanctions imposed in 2018 for undermining democracy.\n\n## TALKS INVOLVE POSSIBLE AUCTIONS WITH US BUYERS\n\nThe officials have been in talks this week about possible sales mechanisms, including auctions to allow interested U.S. buyers to bid for cargoes, and issuing U.S. licenses to PDVSA's business partners that could lead to supply contracts, two sources said.\n\nThose licenses have in the past allowed PDVSA's joint venture partners and customers, including Chevron, India's Reliance [(RELI.NS), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RELI.NS), China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and European Eni [(ENI.MI), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ENI.MI) and Repsol [(REP.MC), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/REP.MC), to have access to Venezuelan oil to refine or to resell to third parties.\n\nThis week, some of those companies have begun making preparations for receiving Venezuelan cargoes again, two sources said.\n\nThe U.S. and Venezuela have also discussed if Venezuelan oil can be used in the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the future, one of the sources said.\n\n## INCREASED OIL FLOWS WOULD BE 'GREAT NEWS'\n\nU.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said on Tuesday that an increased flow of Venezuelan heavy oil to the U.S. Gulf would be \"great news\" for job security, future gasoline prices in the U.S. and for Venezuela.\n\n\"Venezuela has an opportunity now to actually have capital come in and rebuild their economy and take advantage,\" he told Fox News, when asked about this story on the talks between the governments on oil exports. \"With American technology, American partnership, Venezuela can be transformed.\"\n\nU.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast can process Venezuela's heavy crude grades and were importing some 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) before Washington first imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela.\n\nPDVSA has already had to cut production due to the embargo, because it is running out of storage for the oil. If PDVSA does not find a way to export oil soon, it would have to cut production more, one of the sources said.\n\nOil traders reacted to news of the talks on Tuesday.

economy more exposed to trade tensions, U.S.-based research firm Rhodium Group said in a report Monday.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2025, new industries such as artificial intelligence, robotics and electric cars added just 0.8 percentage points to economic output, while real estate and other traditional sectors saw a combined 6 percentage point decline, the report said. The analysis drew on official Chinese data and industry-specific sources.\n\nThe findings come as China seeks to boost technological self-reliance in response to U.S. restrictions. Under a five-year development plan set to kick off in earnest in March, [Beijing is doubling down on advanced technologies](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/china-to-bolster-consumption-tech-development-as-us-tensions-simmer.html) with state investment and favorable policies.\n\n\"China's growth strategy isn't going to work,\" Logan Wright, partner at Rhodium and a co-author of the report, told CNBC. \"They're not going to achieve their targeted rates of GDP growth based on the policies they have outlined so far.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO8:0408:04\n\nMorgan Stanley sees 'year of stabilization' for China markets after strong 2025\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nBeijing has targeted annual GDP growth of around 5% in recent years. For China to sustain that pace, new industries would need to expand sevenfold over the next five years to generate the roughly 2 percentage points of annual investment growth required, Rhodium estimated.\n\nThat translates to an additional 2.8 trillion yuan in new investment required this year — or 120% more than in 2025. While investment in artificial intelligence or robotics could increase in the next year or two, other emerging industries are unlikely to sustain such rapid growth, the analysts said.\n\n\"Electric vehicles have likely already reached their fastest rates of growth, and output in the industry may be slowing in the years ahead,\" the Rhodium report said.\n\n## Property drag deepens\n\nWhile Beijing has prioritized [high-tech development](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/10/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-a-rival-ai-strategy.html), it has taken fewer steps to address a yearslong slump in real estate. The sector [once accounted for more than a quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/09/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-the-hidden-drag-on-chinas-economy.html) of the economy. New home sales by floor area last year fell to levels [not seen since 2009](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-dcid0mnIi8knATU9vEyWg), according to a report last week by the China Real Estate Information Corp.\n\nOnly in recent weeks have sighs appeared that some policymakers are [considering more forceful property support](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/09/china-property-slump-policy-shift-qiushi-2026-ahead-march-meeting.html). China's top leaders are due to formalize economic targets for the year at an annual parliamentary meeting in March.\n\nA macro outlook published by global investment firm KKR estimated that property weakness will shave 1.2 percentage points off China's GDP growth this year. Even with a projected 2.6 percentage point contribution from digital technologies, the estimated total growth was still on the low end at 4.6%.\n\n\"Despite a potential 5% growth target for 2026, headwinds from real estate and a weak job market cast doubt on achievability,\" the report said. KKR predicts the property drag could halve in 2027, but sees limited improvement in digital industries or consumer demand.\n\n## From jobs to trade tensions\n\nAn overemphasis on tech could have broader economic consequences.\n\nNew industrial sectors may offer higher wages, but they employ far fewer people than traditional industries, the Rhodium analysis found.\n\nIncreased factory automation, coupled with China's already high 30% share of global manufacturing output, could lead to the loss of up to 100 million jobs over the next decade — a displacement that would exceed the total workforce of most developed economies, KKR said.\n\nChina's urban unemployment rate remained [above 5%](http://english.scio.gov.cn/pressroom/2025-12/15/content_118228465.html) for much of last year, while youth unemployment has been [about three times higher.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/17/china-youth-unemployment-civil-service-jobs-economy-slowdown.html)\n\nSince it's unlikely that domestic investment, even in newer industries, will produce sufficient demand, \"Beijing will become even more dependent upon gaining market share in export markets,\" the Rhodium report said.\n\n\"China will remain even more reliant upon exports in the future, leaving the economy vulnerable to new trade restrictions,\" the report said.\n\nAs lower-priced Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, have expanded overseas, Mexico and the European Union have joined the U.S. in raising tariffs on imports from China.\n\nWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox  \n [Subscribe now](https://www.cnbc.com/lander?id=chinaconnection-newsletter)\n\nChina's economic imbalance mirrors a similar [divergence in the U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/25/ai-spending-is-boosting-the-economy-many-businesses-in-survival-mode.html), where AI-linked companies have led stock market gains, while [other parts of the economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/business/the-ai-boom-economy.html) have struggled.\n\nBut many in Beijing argue that the country has longer-term interests at stake.\n\nZhang Jianping, a deputy director at China's Commerce Ministry, told CNBC last week that the country's policies are designed to support innovation over multiple years. Traditional industries such as steel and real estate, he added, must integrate new technologies to remain competitive.",

You can subscribe*[*here.*](https://www.cnbc.com/lander?id=chinaconnection-newsletter)\n\n## The big story\n\nFor someone who's witnessed the ups and downs of U.S.-China tensions since the 1990s, James Zimmerman is unexpectedly hopeful about 2026.\n\nThis year, he's back for a fifth term as chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, whose members include [Boeing](/quotes/BA/) and Cargill. His first stint came in 2007 and 2008, when Beijing hosted its first Olympic Games, and the financial crisis hit much of the world. He later served again in 2015 and 2016, as populist movements rose globally and gave Donald Trump his first term as U.S. President.\n\nFast forward a decade, and U.S. businesses have endured everything from the pandemic to escalating tariffs. But the past decade of what Zimmerman calls \"experimenting with competition\" could now give way to something new, with Trump expected to visit China in April.\n\nThis picture taken on November 6, 2018 shows a Chinese and US flag at a booth during the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai.\n\nJohannes Eisele | AFP | Getty Images\n\n*Here are the highlights of our conversation, with responses condensed for clarity:*\n\n**Why are you staying engaged at such a high level, after nearly 30 years in China?**\n\nThe reason I'm involved is because I think this is a very important year.\n\n2026 is important, not just because [it's] the 250th anniversary of the U.S., but the U.S. and China have had 10 years of experimenting with competition, experimenting with calls for decoupling and de-risking.\n\nHas that worked? Not really. So it's now time to go back and, in a way that may be visionary, to get us back on track to have ongoing dialogues, ongoing engagement, because I think, at the end of the day, that will be in the best interest of the U.S. and China.\n\n**Are many U.S. companies decoupling from China?**\n\nNo. We're seeing an evolution. People are starting to adjust. For many sectors, China continues to be a critical market. But it's also an essential part of the global supply chain.\n\nAmerican companies are adjusting to this new normal within the U.S.-China relationship. But there has been some diversifying, and that's a healthy strategy that companies are looking at, but we are not seeing wholesale decoupling at all.\n\nIt's important that we have senior**-**level meetings that bring some clarity, some certainty, some continuity to the relationship.\n\nDialogue matters **—** even the smallest, positive signals, at the presidential level, on engagement are very, very important. Regular, ongoing engagement helps reduce any potential misunderstandings and lowers the risk of unexpected policy shocks, like the back-and-forth over tariffs.\n\n**What kind of opportunity do U.S. businesses have in China as domestic competition rises?**\n\nWe have our white paper, which, in a way, allows us to engage with the Chinese government to seek changes that are positive.\n\nProtection of intellectual property is not just an issue for foreign companies. It's also an issue for Chinese companies.\n\nBoth sides need to tone down the national security issues and not view every slight as a national security matter.\n\nWe can't have an environment where every foreigner is targeted as a potential threat. And that goes both ways: when Chinese companies go to the U.S., we can't take the view that it's a threat to the communities they want to operate in.\n\n**Is the CEO of the China operations losing influence on headquarters in the U.S.?**\n\nIt's something that needs further attention post-pandemic. But that's something that is just a circumstance, especially given what took place during the pandemic, when travel came to a halt.\n\nBut when you look at AmCham, the U.S.-China Business Council and the National Committee for U.S.-China Relations, there's now increased interest in making sure CEOs, academic leaders, as well as congressional leaders, travel to [China to] understand what the environment is all about.\n\nWe try to encourage more people-to-people exchanges. I'm going to be out and about in the community, emphasizing the importance of education as well as the arts. For example, I'm going to a conference at the Juilliard School in Tianjin.\n\n**What's on your agenda at AmCham China for 2026?**\n\nIn some respects**,** we're focused on April when President Trump is planning to come to China. We're hopeful that AmCham will be able to play a role in that. There is a focus on that, and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of work leading up to that visit.\n\nThere'll be some agreements, some understanding, maybe a memorandum of understanding that may come out of that.\n\nWe're not expecting a grand bargain. There just isn't enough time. It was last summer, and we were in the middle of a trade war. And only since October, President Xi, as well as President Trump, met in South Korea, have we started a process [around] let's meet, let's talk, let's keep engaging.\n\nSo I think we're on the right track, but we'll just have to see the progress between now and April. But we're optimistic the signals will come out positive. And again, any level of confidence that can be received from those meetings, I think, is very important to the business community.\n\nA lot of President Trump's predecessors were very visionary about what they viewed as the future of U.S.-China relations.\n\nAnd so, this year, we're hoping that President Trump will also be visionary and seek to move the relationship forward in a way that mutually benefits both the United States and China, its companies, consumers, workers and farmers.\n\n## Top TV picks on CNBC\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:3902:39\n\nUS-China tech co-dependence may grow in 2026: Eurasia Group\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nEurasia Group's Xiaomeng Lu explained why China's tech competition with the U.S. remains intense, but argued that tech co-dependence may expand in 2026, driven by easing export controls, cross-border deals, and the global uptake of Chinese open-source AI models.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO5:0905:09\n\nChina's property slump to persist as consumers shift to rentals: UBS\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nJohn Lam, head of China and Hong Kong property research at UBS Investment Bank, explained why he sees a 10% decline in property prices and new home sales in China for 2026.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO12:3712:37\n\nFantastical to think Venezuela event changed China's decades of Taiwan planning\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nEvan Feigenbaum from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said Venezuela isn't a core interest for China, but if the U.S. were to launch a second strike or a full-scale invasion, China would make \"a lot of hay rhetorically about international law.\"\n\n## Need to know\n\n**China condemns U.S. attack on Venezuela.** Beijing said it was \"[deeply shocked](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/china-response-us-venezuela-strike-economic-interests.html)\" by the U.S. strike on Venezuela Saturday and called for the release of leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife.\n\n**BYD tops Tesla worldwide.** The Chinese automaker officially [sold more](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/chinas-byd-to-overtake-tesla-as-worlds-top-ev-seller-for-first-time.html) battery-powered electric cars than Tesla in 2025 — at 2.26 million units.\n\n**Chinese companies hit Vegas.** Many Chinese humanoid robotic and consumer electronics companies are in Las Vegas this week to showcase their products at the [Consumer Electronics Show](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3338600/chinas-humanoid-robot-makers-hong-kong-start-ups-set-dazzle-ces-2026).\n\n## Quote of the week\n\nBetween the two countries in 2026, we are likely to see some tech co-dependence going on and even growing despite the broader trend of U.S.-China competition.\n\n— [*Xiaomeng Lu, director in Eurasia Group's geo-technology practice*](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/01/02/us-china-tech-co-dependence-may-grow-in-2026-eurasia-group.html)\n\n## In the markets\n\nOnshore Chinese stocks edged higher Wednesday, holding near four-year highs as Beijing continues to push development of its artificial intelligence sector.\n\nGoldman Sachs expects China's equity rally to continue into 2026, though at a slower pace.

McNeal](https://www.cnbc.com/dewardric-mcneal/)\n\n[WATCH LIVE](/live-tv/)\n\nKey Points\n\n* Trump's so-called \"Donroe Doctrine\" framing of Western Hemispheric dominance has led to concerns that China will move on Taiwan to flex its own regional muscle.\n* It is the wrong question to be asking given what has taken place in Venezuela, writes international policy expert Dewardric McNeal.\n* China sees itself as a global power with global interests, ambitions, investments, and supply-chain demands — with the agency to defend and extend those interests in America's so-called backyard.\n\nUS President Donald Trump shows a lapel pin as he speaks during a meeting with US oil companies executives in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on January 9, 2026.\n\nSaul Loeb | Afp | Getty Images\n\nThe conversation in Washington right now is abuzz with talk of [President Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)'s new National Security Strategy and its so-called \"Donroe Doctrine\" framing of Western Hemispheric dominance — a modern corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. That debate had already been simmering in policy circles before the end of last year, but it was turbocharged by the recent U.S. operation in Venezuela. Almost immediately, the familiar question resurfaced: What will China do now?\n\nMuch of that speculation has [fixated on Taiwan](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/us-venezuela-strike-taiwan-china-precedent-russia-ukraine.html). Would Beijing use U.S. kinetic action in Venezuela as justification — or precedent — for moving against the island? That question may be understandable and its implications concerning. However, many believe that it is also the wrong question to be asking.\n\nChina will not use Venezuela as a pretext to invade Taiwan. That is neither how Beijing thinks nor how it operates. Serious analysis demands setting the distraction of seeing China as a reactive power aside, and dealing with a more consequential — and far more uncomfortable — question. It requires that we read and debate China's own strategic documents about our region with the same rigor now being applied to the U.S. National Security Strategy, and take them seriously on their own terms.\n\n[China's newly issued](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202512/10/content_WS693962c3c6d00ca5f9a08069.html) third Policy Paper on Latin America and the Caribbean is not a press release or a reactive and reflexive impulse triggered by Washington. It is a longstanding, well thought out, forward-looking, and deliberately structured approach to achieving China's long-term goals. It includes the range of tools of statecraft that it intends to use, and the pathways through which it plans to sustain its influence. It is an institutional blueprint — dense with political mechanisms, financing pathways, commercial incentives, and a theory of the case for the legitimacy of its engagement and presence in the region rooted in Global South solidarity rather than overt claims of regional hegemony or 18th-century cosplay.\n\nThe [NSS](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf) is explicit about intent. It commits the United States to keeping the hemisphere free of \"hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets,\" ensuring access to \"key strategic locations,\" and denying non-hemispheric competitors' control over \"strategically vital assets.\" Venezuela, in that telling, becomes a proof point: evidence that Washington is prepared to act kinetically to alter political realities when it believes access, stability, or strategic positioning are at risk.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO13:2813:28\n\nBremmer: Trump will focus on increasing military power as it loses economically\n\n[Squawk Box Asia](https://www.cnbc.com/asia-squawk-box/)\n\nBut the Trump NSS also reveals a central analytical vulnerability. It implicitly assumes the United States can grant spheres of influence — cede a region here, consolidate one there — and that so-called \"regional powers\" will accept the arrangement. China does not see itself as a regional power. It sees itself as a global power with global interests, ambitions, investments, and supply-chain demands — and with the agency to defend and extend those interests in America's so-called backyard. The NSS can declare a corollary; it cannot declare away another major power's presence or objectives, particularly one as deeply embedded in the hemisphere as China already is. China's Latin America strategy is engineered to be resilient against exactly this kind of episodic shock.\n\n### How China exerts its influence across the globe\n\nStart with the political architecture. Beijing does not limit its engagement to trade or hydrocarbons, though both [matter a great deal to Beijing](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/china-response-us-venezuela-strike-economic-interests.html). Instead, it pursues head-of-state diplomacy, exchanges between intergovernmental committees, legislature-to-legislature exchanges, political-party engagement, and deep institutional embedding through CELAC, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, a 33-country regional political bloc coordinating cooperation across trade, finance, infrastructure, technology, and people-to-people ties. The objective is explicit: institutionalize influence across \"multi-level, multi-channel\" pathways with a structure that dilutes any single pressure point campaign by the United States. It is far harder to \"flip\" a region when influence runs so deeply through presidents, parties, parliaments, technocrats, students, consumers, and subnational actors simultaneously.\n\nThe economics reinforce that architecture. China frames its engagement — accurately or not — as co-production and co-dependence rather than exploitation or charity. The strategy emphasizes infrastructure connectivity, logistics management, digital infrastructure, smart cities, industrial parks, manufacturing cooperation, and export support. These projects create domestic constituencies: jobs, contracts, port throughput, wages, and broad political winners in the region. Financial cooperation sweetens the model further through local-currency settlement, RMB clearing arrangements, credit and debt swap lines, and even Panda bonds on offer. The aim is straightforward: reduce exposure to U.S. financial leverage, political pressure points, and sanctions risk over time.\n\nTrump's [push for U.S. oil companies to invest](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/what-the-big-oil-executives-told-trump-about-investing-in-venezuela.html) in Venezuela offered a series of security guarantees but surfaced a familiar constraint: executives emphasized that investment also hinges on long-term financing, risk-sharing, and enforceable contracts — support China routinely provides its firms through policy banks and export credits — while Washington has yet to signal a clear willingness to deploy comparable tools via the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation(DFC), Ex-Im Bank, or multilateral finance.\n\nAnd those financial support and assistance tools should not be pursued in a vacuum; when done well, they are designed to anchor influence in physical strategic assets — natural resources, ports, logistics hubs, energy infrastructure, and transit corridors — where economics and geopolitics inevitably intersect.\n\n### $500 billion in trade, Panama Canal confrontation\n\nScale matters. China-Latin America trade exceeded $500 billion in 2024, and the region represents more than 670 million consumers, many of whom are drawn to Chinese products on price, availability, and increasingly quality. These are not marginal markets. They are structural to China's global growth model and export strategy.\n\nBeijing is also candid — if selectively so — about its interest in strategic resources. Energy and critical minerals feature prominently, alongside language about long-term supply arrangements and local-currency pricing. Access spans the value chain from extraction to utilization. For U.S. policymakers, investors, and CEOs, this is the commercial backbone the NSS must contend with. This is not about nostalgia for the Monroe Doctrine; it is a 21st-century strategy designed to achieve many of the same outcomes through more modern means and more seductive rhetoric.\n\nThe Panama Canal brings these strategies into direct collision. China's policy paper treats ports, logistics, and maritime cooperation as first-order instruments of development and influence — and, in a crisis, as latent strategic assets to be exploited during a military confrontation with the regional hegemon (the U.S.). The NSS, meanwhile, explicitly flags \"key strategic locations\" and acknowledges how commercial infrastructure can be repurposed for military use. Panama — more than Venezuela — is where these approaches collide most sharply. [Ongoing debates over port concessions and terminal control](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/22/tanker-seizures-venezuela-oil-china.html) underscore that both Washington and Beijing view the canal itself and canal-adjacent assets as strategic, not merely commercial in nature.\n\nCrew members of Chinese Cosco Shipping Rose container ship wave Chinese and Panamenian flag before China's President Xi Jinping and Panama's Juan Carlso Varela, arrive at the Cocoli locks in the expanded Panama Canal, in Panama City, Panama on December 3, 2018.\n\nLuis Acosta | Afp | Getty Images\n\nSo, does U.S. action in Venezuela change the calculus? In the long run, no.\n\nIt will raise risk premiums for many — for Chinese firms, regional leaders, and global companies caught between compliance regimes, complicate logistics and supply chains, and further the weaponization of market access. It will push some governments to hedge more carefully, demand higher \"insurance\" from Beijing, or seek stronger economic and security assurances from Washington. But it does not erase the fundamentals of what China has spent two decades building: trade corridors, lending relationships, political networks, and now an explicit push into high-tech cooperation — from EVs, AI, and satellites to aerospace and digital trade, and aligning closely with where many Latin American economies want to go.\n\nZoom out one level further and the logic extends north. Greenland and the Arctic are not separate conversations; they are the same set of arguments, just on ice. Washington frames Greenland through minerals, shipping lanes, and military access. Beijing frames the Arctic as an international space with global stakes, governed by international law, where non-Arctic states have legitimate interests. If the U.S. believes spheres can be secured through doctrine plus decisive action, China's operating assumption is the opposite. It believes in focusing its pushback on arguments that the U.S. has used for decades to justify their presence in the Asia-Pacific region — that states have a right to the global commons, that big states have global interests that must be protected, and that a long-term and well establish persistent presence in a region must be respected. China takes these same positions with respect to Latin America and Greenland.\n\nThe action in Venezuela does show that the Trump administration is more serious than its predecessors about reasserting hemispheric dominance — and that the NSS is not merely rhetorical. But China will not be rushing for the exits in the Western Hemisphere. It is deeply entrenched. Smaller powers have agency too. They will not be dictated to without far richer incentives, protections, or more sustained pressure than a single special forces operation can provide.\n\nIf Washington wants a hemisphere that chooses the United States rather than submits to it, it must compete with China's full-stack approach: finance, infrastructure, technology, people-to-people exchange, affordable products, political access, and a compelling narrative of partnership. A declaration in an NSS and one dramatic operation are short-term events. China's engagement in Latin America is a long game, and the competition it sets in motion will be neither quick nor simple.\n\n—*By* [*Dewardric McNeal*](https://www.cnbc.com/dewardric-mcneal/)*, Managing Director and Senior Policy Analyst at Longview Global, and a CNBC Contributor*\n\n## [More In The Bottom Line](https://www.cnbc.com/global-cfo-council/)\n\n[The crypto ATM's days in America may be numbered](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/bitcoin-crypto-atm-scam-fraud-regulation.html)\n\n[Kevin Williams](https://www.cnbc.com/kevin-williams/)\n\n[Op-ed: China won the 2025 battle in Trump's trade war.

The Trade Management Market focuses on software and services that help organizations efficiently manage international trade operations, including compliance, documentation, customs filing, and tariff management. It supports businesses in navigating complex global trade regulations, reducing operational risks, and improving supply chain visibility.\n\n**Download PDF Brochure@**[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=70680100](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=70680100&utm_campaign=trademanagementmarket&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=referral)\n\n**Large Enterprises segment to have the highest market share during the forecast period**\n\nComplex trade operations are handled by large businesses in industries like consumer goods and retail, healthcare, aerospace and defence, and transportation and logistics. These businesses have a very robust and extensive network of regionally dispersed suppliers and partners. Large businesses handle the import and export of high-value items to and from many nations. Large firms are important players in the trade management market because they manage the extensive network and adhere to the rules to avoid harsh penalties.\n\n**Transportation and Logistics is expected have the highest market share during the forecast period**\n\nThe transportation and logistics industry has benefited greatly from rising globalisation. As new technologies streamline its basic processes, the transportation and logistics sector is undergoing a digital transition. The transportation and logistics sectors are under pressure to reduce operational costs and streamline trade procedures as a result of the expansion of global trade. Trade management tools give transportation and logistics organisations the visibility they need to oversee shipments and inventories and deliver dependable services.\n\n**North America region to record the highest market share in the trade management market**\n\nDuring the projected period, North America is anticipated to hold the biggest market share for trade management. North America, which is regarded as one of the most developed regions in terms of technology adoption and infrastructure, makes up the majority of GTM solutions and services. Another critical element supporting the expansion of the trade management sector is a robust infrastructure supporting international trade in this area. The expansion of the trade management market in North America is projected to be supported by significant investments in the aerospace and defence, healthcare, and life sciences sectors.\n\n**Request Sample Pages@**[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=70680100](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=70680100&utm_campaign=trademanagementmarket&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=referral)\n\n**Unique Features in the Trade Management Market**\n\nTrade management platforms come with built-in compliance engines that automatically update and enforce global trade regulations, tariff changes, sanctions lists, and restricted party screening. This reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and protects businesses from costly fines and shipment holds.\n\nOne of the standout features is real-time visibility into trade operations, including shipment tracking, customs clearance status, and documentation flow. This transparency enables quicker response to delays, exceptions, or disruptions across global supply chains.\n\nInnovative tools for tariff classification, duty drawback processing, free trade agreement (FTA) qualification, and duty optimization help companies reduce landed costs. These features empower users to strategically plan imports/exports and maximize cost savings.\n\nTrade management solutions uniquely offer centralized creation, validation, and storage of all trade documents—such as commercial invoices, packing lists, certificates of origin, and bills of lading—facilitating accuracy, audit readiness, and faster customs processing.\n\n**Major Highlights of the Trade Management Market**\n\nThe trade management market has seen significant expansion as global trade volumes increase and e-commerce continues to flourish. Businesses are investing in robust trade solutions to manage the complexities of international shipment flows, cross-border compliance, and multi-modal logistics more efficiently.\n\nA major highlight is the strong adoption of cloud-native trade management systems that offer scalability, real-time data access, and seamless integration with ERP, TMS, and customs systems. These platforms enable better collaboration, faster deployment, and lower IT overhead.\n\nWith constantly evolving trade regulations, companies are prioritizing advanced compliance automation, tariff management, and restricted party screening. This emphasis helps avoid fines, shipment delays, and reputational risk while maintaining smoother customs clearance.\n\nModern trade management solutions are incorporating analytics and AI-driven insights to provide predictive risk assessments, landed cost optimization, and performance benchmarking. These capabilities empower businesses to make strategic decisions that can reduce costs and improve operational efficiency.\n\n**Inquire Before Buying@**[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry\\_Before\\_BuyingNew.asp?id=70680100](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=70680100&utm_campaign=trademanagementmarket&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=referral)\n\n**Top Companies in the Trade Management Market**\n\nKey and innovative vendors in the trade management market are Oracle (US), Infor (US), Thomson Reuters (US), Livingston International (Canada), Aptean (US), SAP (Germany), Noatum Logistics (Spain), E2open (US), Descartes (Canada), CargoWise (Australia), Expeditors (US), BDP International (US), Accuity (US), QAD Precision (US), 3rdwave (Canada), AEB (Germany), Shipsy (India), Bamboo Rose (US), Bolero International (UK), MIC Customs Solutions (UK), OCR Services (US), Webb Fontaine (UAE), Neurored (Spain), 4PL Consultancy (UK), Global Custom Compliance (China), Vigilant Global Trade Services (US), and Centrade (US).\n\nOracle offers goods and services that cover all facets of business IT, including platforms, applications, and infrastructures.

The dollar is coming off its worst annual performance since 2017, with analysts predicting another year of decline.\n\n\"The U.S. economy still looks pretty good. A lot of the positioning in short U.S. dollar has already been done, and I think that's going to prevent the dollar from getting significantly weaker going forward,\" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis.\n\n\"I think the winners could be some emerging market currencies more than the euro or the yen,” he added.\n\nTraders are pricing in at least two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year, although a divided central bank indicated in December there would be only one cut in 2026. The Fed is expected to keep rates steady at its meeting this month.\n\nMarkets have kept geopolitical concerns in the background, focusing on economic data instead.\n\nHowever, risks that President Donald Trump's administration could be forced to refund more than to importers if the U.S. Supreme Court this week declares his duties unlawful could resurface to hurt the dollar.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday the 2027 U.S. military budget should be $1.5 trillion, stoking some concerns about rising debt and a [higher risk premium](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-dip-defense-firms-climb-up-trump-budget-plans-2026-01-08/) on U.S. assets.\n\n## EURO ZONE DATA AND GREENLAND IN FOCUS\n\nOn the euro front, recent inflation figures drove the currency lower and German Bund yields to a one-month low.\n\nThe euro was down 0.05% at $1.1669 on Thursday, after dropping by 0.45% in the last two sessions.\n\n“Soft European inflation reinforces dovish sentiment, while the Greenland crisis underscores Europe’s relative vulnerability, potentially triggering further euro selling,” said Olivier Korber, foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Trump retained the option to address his objective to take over [Greenland by military means](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-move-greenland-2026-01-07/), while alarmed allies, including France and Germany, were working on a response.\n\nAnalysts flagged that the debate about changes in the European Central Bank policy shifted towards the possibility of a rate hike a year from now, while inflation is currently getting back to target with core edging lower.\n\nThe Japanese yen was roughly unchanged at 156.70 per U.S. dollar.\n\n\"For those hoping for a significant appreciation of the yen, the only option for now is to wait for the conflict with China to cool down again,\" said Michael Pfister, foreign exchange strategist at Commerzbank.\n\n“The Chinese government could further escalate the conflict with a complete export ban on rare earths, which would deal a significant blow to the yen,” he added.\n\n[Shares in Japanese chemical manufacturers fell](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-chemical-makers-fall-after-china-anti-dumping-probe-announcement-2026-01-08/) on Thursday while those of their Chinese rivals jumped after China said it was launching an anti-dumping probe into imports of chemicals used in chipmaking.\n\nThe Australian dollar eased to $0.6704, just below the 15-month high it touched earlier this week.\n\nReporting by Stefano Rebaudo and Sophie Kiderlin;

Any resemblances to actual future events are purely coincidental. This scenario is plausible, but certainly not inevitable. It is offered in the modest hope that it will inspire and inform efforts to prevent the disastrous outcome described here.\n\nIt is January 2028. Looking back, the Americans did not “take” Greenland—not in any concrete sense. There was no invasion, no purchase, not even a plebiscite. But in the shadowy corridors of Arctic politics, Washington moved deliberately to confound its opponents. The Americanization of Greenland transcended brute imperial force in the Russian mold.\n\nTwo years earlier, in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s showy military ouster of Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro—and Trump’s insistence that he intended to take over Greenland next—foreign policy analysts had been scrambling to imagine how he might seize the island. Would he force Denmark to sell its semiautonomous territory? Send in the troops, effectively attacking a NATO ally? But Trump didn’t have to do either. Instead, his administration pioneered a new form of twenty-first-century imperialism in which sovereignty over territory is imposed less by force than by function, through investments, contractors, and legal ambiguities. In the process, Trump’s Greenland gambit rewrote the rules of international order and created a template that Beijing, Moscow, and others soon followed. Now known as “geo-osmosis,” what follows is the story of how it happened.\n\n### **FROM TROLLING TO TRUTH**\n\nTrump originally floated the idea of acquiring Greenland in his first term. The 2019 revelation that he had inquired about purchasing the territory from Denmark was met with global bemusement and a curt “Greenland is not for sale” response from the Danish and Greenlandic governments. Few in Brussels, Copenhagen, or Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, took the threat seriously. After all, Trump had long trafficked in hyperbolic bombast.\n\nSeasoned Trump observers noted, however, that the idea of territorial acquisition had long held a special place in Trump’s worldview. Greenland grabbed Trump’s attention as “essentially, a big real estate deal,” as he put it, an accomplishment that the journalists Peter Baker and Susan Glasser note in a 2022 book “might give him a place in American history like William Seward’s purchase of Alaska from Russia.”\n\nEarly in his second term, Trump revived the proposal and gave it a geopolitical rationale. His argument that the United States should control Greenland had three pillars: It would help the country secure critical resources—the island is estimated to have enormous oil and gas reserves as well as troves of rare-earth minerals such as cobalt, graphite, and lithium. It would expand the U.S. military’s reach in the Arctic. And it would limit Chinese and Russian influence in a territory key to U.S. national security.\n\nBut when Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen offered to give the U.S. president more or less anything he wanted short of sovereignty to achieve those goals, Trump simply refused. It became clear that he was not actually interested in Arctic security. Rather, Greenland became the first in a series of Trumpian territorial ambitions that included Canada, the Panama Canal, and even the Gaza Strip—acquisitions that he apparently believed might secure his place on Mount Rushmore.\n\nAs was so often the case with Trump, it was difficult to separate the trolling from the truth. But it soon emerged that Greenland was a genuine target. With a more loyal second-term team ready to carry out his whims and a supine Congress, his administration was able to create a plan to make his desire a reality.\n\n### **ABSORB AND CONQUER**\n\nIn Greenland, the Trump administration lifted a few elements from its Venezuela template: for instance, the administration directed U.S. spy agencies to step up efforts to identify people in Greenland and Denmark who could support their objectives for the island, just as it leaned on the CIA to help overthrow Maduro. But Trump’s apparatchiks quickly concluded that the best way to control Greenland was not to follow the Venezuela model or to buy Greenland. Regardless of its immediate success, overt military action against a NATO ally would only ignite local and global opposition and limit the United States’ ability to assert sovereignty over the island. But they could control it by cleverly exploiting its supply dependencies.\n\nThe administration understood that Greenland was economically and politically fragile. At 56,000 people, its population was 500 times smaller than Venezuela’s. Manhattan’s East Village had more residents. A mostly uninhabitable ice sheet a quarter of the size of the U.S. mainland, its people were scattered and its infrastructure spotty; with only 93 miles of roads, many Greenlandic communities could reach the others only by boat, small plane, snowmobile, or dogsled, and less than 70 percent of the population used the Internet. Greenlanders had long resented Danish rule and accused the Danish government of keeping them poor and dependent. The island’s semiautonomous government, limited budgetary sovereignty, and simmering independence movement—most Greenlandic political parties ostensibly wanted the territory to gain full autonomy—made it highly susceptible to external influence. Add to this a thin institutional infrastructure and a lack of indigenous wealth, and you had an ideal laboratory for what Trump officials at the time termed “motivated alignment.”\n\nA planning cell in the White House began drafting what was euphemistically titled the Northern Strategic Realignment Initiative. With information from U.S. spy agencies in hand, in May 2026, the Trump administration announced a $10 billion “strategic development initiative” for Greenland, ostensibly to upgrade infrastructure and promote the exploitation of the island’s natural resources.\n\n> The Americans did not need the Greenlandic population’s consent.\n\nWashington moved through proxies. A patchwork of development consortiums, disaster response teams, nongovernmental organizations, consultants, and Arctic energy forums, almost all boasting loose ties to Trump-aligned donors or U.S. government funding, descended on Greenland in the summer of 2026. The activities of these polite people were ostensibly civilian: installing broadband, training local officials, or building roads, small airports, and health centers. Investment was deployed not nationally but municipally. Coastal communities received critical supplies, construction contracts, and digital infrastructure grants. The money came with no overt political strings, but it did have an accompanying series of technical agreements and memorandums that quietly shifted local loyalties and forced budgetary dependence.\n\nThis flurry of help and investment did not fool most Greenlanders. As early as January 2025, a survey jointly commissioned by Danish and Greenlandic newspapers showed that over 85 percent of the island’s residents opposed Greenland’s incorporation into the United States, and those numbers never changed very much. Greenlanders feared the erosion of their culture and autonomy, not to mention having to navigate the nightmare of the U.S. health-care system. But some of Greenland’s government officials and community leaders, long frustrated by Copenhagen’s paternalism and budget constraints, found themselves tempted by these American offers.\n\nThus, the U.S. efforts set the terms of Greenland’s next political phase. The Americans funded local media. They offered fellowships to emerging political leaders. Washington pushed a framing of Greenlandic identity in opposition to Danish “colonialism”—and as compatible with U.S. patronage. Ultimately, the Americans did not need the population’s consent. They just needed a few collaborators amid a general sense of fatigue and cynicism with politics as usual—an attitude Trump’s team is skilled at seeding.\n\n### **FEALTY FOLLOWS FUNCTION**\n\nThe sovereignty campaign was therefore not one of persuasion. It was one of circumvention and absorption. Trump’s advisers understood that Greenland’s democratic mechanisms could be rerouted by fragmenting the elite, creating greater economic dependence, and generating a need for emergency governance. Danish resupply routes began to face delays as ships were stopped and searched at sea. Fuel shortages, medical supply bottlenecks, and bureaucratic “miscommunications” caused by unexplained electricity and Internet outages pushed municipalities toward the only actors offering an alternative: the Americans.\n\nAround 150 U.S. service members had already been stationed at Pituffik Space Base in northern Greenland. But acting on humanitarian grounds, the U.S. military rapidly expanded its footprint. Emergency logistics hubs became new de facto bases. U.S. contractors took over local security training. By October, several Greenlandic lawmakers had formed a “Sovereign Future Caucus,” signaling their openness to “alternative security and economic partnerships.” One Trump adviser described it as “the Taiwan model in reverse: build deep ties first and let the sovereignty claims follow.”\n\nBy early 2027, Greenland was operating in a sovereignty twilight. Formally, it was still part of the Danish realm, but it had become functionally dependent on a U.S. presidential administration that had not even bothered to try to secure Greenlandic popular support.\n\n> Greenland’s democratic mechanisms could be rerouted.\n\nTo move from de facto integration toward de jure sovereignty, the U.S. Justice Department assembled a legal framework that invoked historical precedent. Drawing on the 1917 U.S. purchase of the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands), and citing Greenland’s right to self-determination under the UN Charter, Trump administration lawyers constructed what they called a sovereignty transition plan.\n\nThe Trump team avoided a national referendum, knowing it would fail. Instead, the administration encouraged the Greenlandic parliament to adopt a declaration of “provisional autonomy” and offered Washington’s recognition of Greenlandic sovereignty in principle. It was a phrase loaded with possibilities and devoid of obligations. A letter of support from pro-American Greenlandic officials, signed in July 2027, set the plan in motion. The U.S. then formally beganstationing U.S. security forces in Nuuk, using the letter to claim that they had been invited by the Greenlandic parliament, even though no vote had been held.\n\nIn October 2027, Greenland’s parliament declared provisional autonomy and an “interim sovereignty transition.” The United States raised its flag over new “civil-military liaison offices” in Nuuk and Greenland’s three next-largest towns. Negotiations to grant Greenland a compact of free association, akin to those the United States has with Micronesia or the Marshall Islands, began immediately afterward.\n\n### **EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN**\n\nThese efforts, of course, ignited a firestorm in Denmark. The Danish government declared the sovereignty transition plan a “hostile act” and withdrew its ambassador from Washington. The European Union denounced it as a violation of international law. The French president called it “a colonial anachronism wrapped in nationalist theatrics.” But Denmark had little military or economic leverage to wield. And the EU, more focused on managing other elements of its strained relationship with the United States, was unwilling to do anything beyond “monitoring the situation.”\n\nMeanwhile, Russian bombers conducted patrols near Greenlandic airspace. Chinese state media outlets declared the United States a “rogue imperialist actor,” even as many of their diplomats took notes. But these efforts only strengthened Trump’s case that the United States needed to control Greenland to protect it—and shore up U.S. national security.\n\nThe Greenland gambit divided American public opinion: MAGA conservatives hailed Trump’s move as a “strategic masterstroke,” while critics likened it to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and warned that the United States’ global credibility had suffered irreparably. But the administration’s media machine lurched into action, launching a public relations campaign called “America’s Frozen Frontier,” and Fox News aired segments with AI-generated images of Greenlandic children waving U.S. flags. Maps were redrawn. Trump rallies in Michigan and Pennsylvania featured chants of “Make Greenland Great Again.” The Trump Organization announced plans to make the island the “biggest, most beautiful winter resort” in human history, with fjord-based heli-skiing and extensive glamping opportunities.\n\nDenmark challenged the United States’ moves at the International Court of Justice, but the case languished in procedural purgatory, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed it as “nonsense.” Indigenous Greenlandic voices remained split: although some elites embraced U.S. investments, most residents warned of coming environmental degradation and cultural erasure. None of that mattered. U.S. contractors continued to deliver services. Washington concluded its association compact with Nuuk, assumed full authority over Greenland’s defense and security affairs, and asserted a claim that Greenland represented a U.S. “special economic zone.” Trump declared victory.\n\n### **THE COLD BENEATH THE ICE**\n\nDecades later, the Greenland gambit would be studied as the prototype for a new form of state expansion, one that blurs the lines between consent, coercion, and capitulation. The Trump administration showed that territory need not be seized when it can be absorbed. It affirmed a simple truth of twenty-first-century geopolitics: in the absence of coherent international resistance, norms matter little; facts on the ground suffice. Commentators drew a direct line from the Trump team’s effort in Greenland to the later Russian absorption of Georgia and, of course, the Chinese takeover of Taiwan.\n\nIt also redefined the nature of international order and sovereignty. Manufactured dependence was no longer considered a form of imperialism; they became a method for building fraternal ties. Indigenous populations no longer determined sovereignty; supply chains did. And, perhaps most tellingly, the unimaginable became more than just possible. It became marketable.\n\nLoading...\n\n### You are reading a free article\n\nSubscribe to *Foreign Affairs* to get unlimited access.\n\n* Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n* Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n* Unlock access to the *Foreign Affairs* app for reading on the go\n\nAlready a subscriber?

MAY 06: China's research icebreaker Xuelong 2, or Snow Dragon 2, arrives at Waigaoqiao port after over 5-month Antarctic expedition on May 6, 2021 in Shanghai, China.\n\nVcg | Visual China Group | Getty Images\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's renewed threat to take control of Greenland has raised alarm in Beijing, following Washington's military operation that seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nTrump, who has long advocated U.S. control over the self-governing Danish territory, repeatedly emphasized on Sunday that Greenland is strategically important.\n\n\"We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" Trump told reporters [aboard Air Force One](https://youtu.be/9XVjd3R2T3g?si=x2TZQwO1Y0tBR0hB&t=1465).\n\nIn an [email to Chinese state media Xinhua](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/9KPVg29SLc3qYMjs8f73LQ) News Agency, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump views acquiring Greenland as a national security priority to deter rivals in the Arctic. She added that his team is weighing a range of options — including the possibility of using military force.\n\nChinese authorities have [pushed back](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202601/t20260105_11806736.html). On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized Washington for \"using the so-called 'China threat' as a pretext for itself to seek selfish gains.\"\n\n## Frozen frontiers\n\nChina described itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in its [2018 official Arctic Policy](https://english.www.gov.cn/archive/white_paper/2018/01/26/content_281476026660336.htm), asserting its right to use resources and develop shipping routes in the Arctic.\n\nState-linked Chinese firms have also invested heavily in Arctic energy projects and developed maritime routes that could reduce shipping times between Asia and Europe.\n\n\"China would push back hard against any U.S. move to take control of Greenland, given Beijing's commercial interests on the island — from resource exploration to the security of Arctic shipping routes,\" said Xinbo Wu, director at the Center for American Studies at Shanghai-based Fudan University.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department [has identified China and Russia as key competitors](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3855787/now-the-hard-part-implementing-arctic-strategy/) in the region, pointing to their expanded military capabilities and joint naval patrols as risks to national security.\n\nBeijing could seek to raise costs for Washington through multilateral diplomacy and may deepen military cooperation with Russia in the Arctic region to deter the U.S., Wu said.\n\n\"We are really getting into uncharted territory and we have to be extremely careful,\" said Henry Wang, founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization, a think-tank that often aligns with Beijing's thinking.\n\n\"The international community has to work together now and probably stop this kind of unilateral approach.\"\n\n## Energy, rare earths, infrastructure\n\nBeijing's main interests in Greenland mirror those of the U.S.: [rare earths](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/greenland-rare-earths-us-china-processing-reality-mining-arctic-shipping-lanes-route-critical-minerals.html), uranium and zinc, said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group.\n\nGreenland, a vast and sparsely populated autonomous Danish territory, hosts several large rare-earth element deposits, with some discovered mines ranking [among the world's largest](https://eng.geus.dk/media/13174/go29.pdf). These minerals are crucial for high-tech industries, from electric vehicles to defense equipment.\n\nBesides the U.S. and China, the [European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6166) has also tried to secure access to these critical mineral supplies.\n\nChinese investors have grown \"much more cautious\" about Greenland in recent years amid rising geopolitical uncertainty, said Patrik Andersson, an analyst at the Swedish National China Center at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs.\n\nDenmark retains the legal authority to block foreign investments on national security grounds.\n\nIn 2016, a Hong Kong-linked firm attempted to acquire a former Danish naval base and related port facilities, prompting Copenhagen to block the sale. A Chinese state-owned firm also withdrew its bid for an airport construction contract worth 3.6 billion Danish kroner ($563 million) in 2019 after Greenland chose Denmark over Beijing to finance the project.\n\nAndersson noted that in some cases, Chinese interest in Greenland's minerals appeared to have already declined before the recent rise in geopolitical risk, in part due to the high costs of operating in Greenland.\n\n\"From a commercial standpoint, Chinese investors may see more attractive opportunities elsewhere,\" he added.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO6:3606:36\n\nTrump's Greenland ambitions are a wake up call: Chinese think tank\n\n[The China Connection](https://www.cnbc.com/the-china-connection/)\n\nSome Chinese-backed projects in Greenland have also stalled over environmental concerns.\n\nChinese state-affiliated company [Shenghe Resources](/quotes/392-SZ/) acquired a stake in [the Kvanefjeld project in south](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2020/presence-before-power/4-greenland-what-is-china-doing-there-and-why/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20Kvanefjeld,Kvanefjeld%20site.%EF%BB%BF%5B75%5D)[ern Greenland in 2016](https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20161031/pdf/43ch5gzhvhrmhq.pdf). The project, which was set to become one of the world's largest rare-earth and uranium mines, was halted after Greenland [reinstated a ban](https://archive.is/3cbEl) on uranium mining in 2021.\n\nWhile some analysts have estimated Chinese investments in the Arctic at over $90 billion and described them as \"unconstrained,\" Harvard University's Kennedy School said the figures are \"highly exaggerated\" because they included failed investments and unbuilt projects.\n\nAccording to [Harvard's estimates](https://www.belfercenter.org/research-analysis/china-arctic-investments) in June 2025, most of the mineral, oil and gas resource projects in Greenland with Chinese backing had been paused or canceled.\n\nDespite those setbacks, Greenland [opened its representation office in Beijing in 2023](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-10-28/VHJhbnNjcmlwdDc1NTc3/index.html) as the Arctic country sought to deepen ties with Beijing.\n\n## 'Polar Silk Road'\n\nChina has eyes on new shipping routes opening up as melting ice opens shorter paths between Asia and Europe. China's exports to the European Union, its second-largest trading bloc, [grew 8.1% year-on-year](http://www.customs.gov.cn/customs/2025-12/08/article_2025122717403341061.html) in the first eleven months of 2025.\n\nBeijing formally introduced the \"Polar Silk Road\" in its 2018 Arctic policy white paper and launched its [first Arctic shipping route to Europe](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202509/1344211.shtml) in September 2025, cutting transit times to about 20 days, roughly half the time needed for a journey through [the Suez Canal](https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/p/0P9505FV.html).\n\nThe alternative sea route presents not only \"immense economic opportunities\" for Beijing through faster trade and access to untapped natural resources, but also a \"strategic challenge to the United States' dominance of global sea lanes,\" said Zoha Fatima, a researcher focused on Arctic governance and geopolitics.\n\nChina has also expanded Arctic research efforts over the years, supporting discoveries related to sea ice composition, space weather and marine life.\n\nBuilding on existing projects in Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland, China has also [planned a research](https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/online-analysis/2020/02/china-arctic/) and satellite ground station in Greenland.\n\nThese facilities are crucial for China's Beidou navigation satellite system, developed as an alternative to the U.S.'s GPS system.\n\nChina's polar research programs have raised security concerns in the Arctic. In 2022, the Biden administration [asserted that](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/National-Strategy-for-the-Arctic-Region.pdf) China used its scientific engagements to conduct \"dual-use research with intelligence or military applications.\"\n\n\"If Trump were to take Greenland, Beijing would frame this as U.S. unilateralism and North Atlantic militarization, while stressing respect for Danish-Greenlandic autonomy and UN-based rules,\" said Eurasia's Wang.\n\n*— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng, Emily Tan contributed to this story.*",

But the crisis has exposed an uncomfortable reality - Denmark is [rallying support](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-move-greenland-2026-01-07/) to protect a territory whose population wants independence, and whose largest opposition party now wants to bypass Copenhagen and [negotiate directly with Washington](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-should-hold-talks-with-us-without-denmark-opposition-leader-says-2026-01-08/).\n\nSign up[here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fdenmarks-greenland-dilemma-defending-territory-already-its-way-out-2026-01-10%2F)\n\n\"Denmark risks exhausting its foreign policy capital to secure Greenland, only to watch it walk away afterwards,\" said Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen, a political science professor at University of Copenhagen.\n\n## STRATEGIC RELEVANCE\n\nDenmark cannot let Greenland go without losing its [geopolitical relevance](https://www.reuters.com/world/why-does-trump-want-greenland-could-he-get-it-2025-01-08/) in the [Arctic territory](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GREENLAND-ELECTION/MAPS/zjvqaeledvx/), strategically located between Europe and North America and a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system.\n\nYet it may ultimately have nothing to show for its efforts if [Greenlanders choose independence](https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland/) - or strike their own deal with Washington.\n\nThe stakes extend beyond Denmark's national interests. European allies have rallied behind Denmark not just out of solidarity, but because giving up Greenland would set a dangerous precedent that could embolden other powers to pursue territorial claims against smaller nations, upending the post-1945 world order.\n\nDenmark's foreign ministry declined to comment, but referred to joint remarks by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on December 22.\n\n\"National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,\" the two leaders said. \"They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country ... Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.\"\n\nThis week, Frederiksen said: \"If the U.S. chooses to attack another NATO country, everything stops, including NATO and the security the alliance has provided since World War Two.\"\n\n## THE 'GREENLAND CARD'\n\nFor now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table, including buying the territory or taking it by force.\n\nCopenhagen professor Rasmussen said any discussion of whether holding on to Greenland is worth the cost has been drowned out by outrage at Trump's threats.\n\n\"It is not part of the political debate in Denmark. I fear we have gone into patriotic overdrive,\" he said.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Greenland's strategic location gave Denmark outsized influence in Washington and allowed it to maintain lower defence spending than would otherwise be expected of a NATO ally.\n\nThis became known as \"the Greenland Card\", according to a 2017 report by the University of Copenhagen's Centre for Military Studies.\n\nBut Greenland's aspirations for self-determination have been brewing since the former colony got greater autonomy and its own parliament in 1979. A 2009 agreement explicitly recognised Greenlanders' right to independence if they choose.\n\nAll Greenlandic parties say they want independence, but differ on how, and when, to achieve it.\n\nTrump's pressure has accelerated a timeline that was already in motion, forcing Copenhagen to spend political capital and financial resources on a relationship with an increasingly uncertain endpoint.\n\n\"How much should we fight for someone who doesn't really care about us?\" Joachim B. Olsen, a political commentator and former Danish lawmaker, told Reuters.\n\n## THE FINANCIAL BURDEN\n\nCopenhagen provides an annual block grant of roughly 4.3 billion Danish crowns ($610 million) to Greenland's economy, which is near stagnation with GDP growth of just 0.2% in 2025.\n\nThe central bank estimates an annual financing gap of approximately 800 million Danish crowns to make current public finances sustainable. Denmark also covers police, the justice system and defence - bringing total annual spending to just under $1 billion.\n\nIn addition, Copenhagen last year announced a 42 billion Danish crowns ($6.54 billion) [Arctic defence package](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/denmark-boost-arctic-defence-by-426-billion-greenland-government-says-2025-10-10/) in response to U.S. criticism that Denmark has not done enough to protect Greenland.\n\nSome reject framing the relationship in [transactional terms](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/can-us-put-price-tag-greenland-2026-01-09/), pointing to Denmark's legal and moral obligations under international law and centuries of shared history.\n\n\"We're talking about family relations, long history of relations between Denmark and Greenland,\" said Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. \"So this is much more, it's not just about defence and economy, it's about feelings, it's about culture.\"\n\n## DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT\n\nPrime Minister Frederiksen faces a difficult balancing act, said Serafima Andreeva, researcher at Oslo-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute.\n\nFor now, Denmark has little choice but to stand firm to maintain its diplomatic credibility, but in doing so risks the relationship with the United States at a time \"when Russia is an accelerating threat and being on the U.S.'s bad side is no good for anyone in the West\".\n\nFrederiksen also faces an election this year, though Greenland has not been a major theme.\n\n\"I don't understand why we have to cling to this community with Greenland when they so badly want out of it,\" Lone Frank, a Danish science writer and broadcaster, told Reuters. \"To be completely honest, Greenland doesn't inspire any sense of belonging in me.\"\n\nReporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen; additional reporting by Soren Sirich Jeppesen and Tom Little; Editing by Alex Richardson\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen](/authors/jacob-gronholt-pedersen/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nBased in Copenhagen, Jacob oversees reporting from Denmark, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

They rely on the extra interest income to offset losses when some cardholders default, making it harder to lend profitably to riskier customers.\n\n\"We estimate it would swing the business to unprofitable if enacted, with subprime credit cards hardest hit,\" Truist Securities wrote in a note.\n\nIn a joint statement, banking industry bodies said the move will hurt \"millions of American families and small business owners.\"\n\n## HOW WILL BANKS AND CONSUMER LENDERS BE IMPACTED?\n\nFor banks and consumer lenders, an interest-rate cap would cut into one of their most profitable lending businesses. Credit card interest rates can climb as high as 30%, compared with an average rate just above 6% on a 30-year fixed mortgage, according to Bankrate.\n\nA rate cap could wipe out billions of dollars in interest income for banks and card issuers, analysts say, forcing lenders to rethink the scale and pricing of their card businesses.\n\n\"If this were to be enacted, there will be material headwinds to card profitability and likely result in card issuers tightening credit boxes meaningfully, particularly to high-risk borrowers,\" analysts at Barclays said.\n\n## WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM A CAP ON CREDIT CARD INTEREST RATES?\n\nA tightening of credit in a heavily regulated banking sector could push some consumers, particularly subprime borrowers, toward buy-now, pay-later providers, pawn shops and even loan sharks.\n\n\"This rate cap would not address the root of the problem and could push consumers towards more expensive debt if the cap does not apply to other unsecured consumer products,\" J.P. Morgan analysts said.\n\n\"It could push more borrowing away from banks into other unsecured loans such as pawn shops and other non-bank consumer lenders.\"\n\nBorrowing from the less regulated parts of the credit market would increase risks for consumers already under financial strain.\n\nBuy-now, pay-later services, which typically earn money from merchants rather than charging interest to consumers, have surged in popularity in recent years, particularly among younger borrowers, and could benefit if banks rein in credit card lending.\n\nReporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[Manya Saini](/authors/manya-saini/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nManya reports on prominent publicly listed U.S. financial firms, including Wall Street’s biggest banks, card companies, asset managers, and fintechs.
